            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And truelie, the Methode &amp; order that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath taken therein is so excellent, and the doctrine and instructions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9371:3"/> spirituall life, (wherin the Author hath very discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed his stile to serue both their capacities, and especially of the vnlearned,) that diuers god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned Diuines intending to treat in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the same arguments, haue plainely, &amp; with great humility confessed, that he writeth with such a rare vertuous spirit, and hath such a singuler gift in explaning his instructions, and in pearcing the hart of a Christian reader, with his zelous god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduises, &amp; perswations, that they haue therefore eyther a bridged or translated his bookes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them vnto diuers noble vertuous persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that requested them to treate of those matters.</p>
            <p>And for mine owne opinion, hauing read a great number of spirituall bookes in diuers languages, (all worthy certainly of great commendation,) yet could I neuer find any, whose spirit and wise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of writing hath so well liked my taste, and iudgement, as this godly Authors books, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie this <hi>Memoriall of a Christian life.</hi>

            <p>And would God, that the late Apostatas, <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Caluin, Beza,</hi> and other their Schollers, pretending now to be reformers of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9371:3"/> Christs Catholicke church in this our corrupt age, had followed the same godly order of proceeding in their manner of preaching Reformation.</p>
            <p>For in my simple iudgement, the right assured way to reforme christendome, being at this present so far corrupted in euery country, is not by force of Armes, nor by terrour, and constraint of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous penall lawes, for feitures, confiscations, and executions, with terrible deaths: because the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian common wealth in such a generall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all estates cannot by any other meanes bee duely reformed, maintained and preserued,<note place="margin">The right assured way to reforme christēdome</note> but by such as it was at the first founded, and increased. As by the Bishops and Pastors preaching of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, contempt of the world, mortification of the flesh, and giuing themselues apparant good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof to the common people, and shewing more christian charitable zeale in their deeds, than in their words, which was the godly order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Apostles, and auncient holie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops their Successors, in founding and increasing the christian religion in the Primitiue church.</p>
            <p>And the like godly order of proceeding for Reformation of the christian State, hath in some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges afterwards bin vsed by <hi>S. Benedict, S. Barnard, S.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>IKE AS the tastes and iudgementes of writers haue bin diuerse (good Christian Reader) euen so the matters and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherof they haue treated, haue bin also diuers. Some there haue bin, which being affectionated vnto the beauty of eloquence, haue imployed themselues to frame a perfect Orator, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him from his childhood, and leading him through all the steps and degrees of that facultie, vntill they haue brought him vnto the highest perfection of the same. Others haue indeuoured after the like sort to forme a perfect Prince, others a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, others a Courtiour. And thus hath each one trauailed to extoll and aduance that thing with his penne which hee moste esteemed. Now of this are wee right well
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9371:16"/> assured, that among all the thinges of this world, there is nothing of greater price &amp; estimation, nothing more excellent &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, than a perfect Christian. The which as he is ordained vnto a supernaturall end, so the life which hee liueth is also superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall: for which cause hee is called of the Holy Fathers a heauenly man, or an earthly angell. Wherefore sith that our faculties (which are so much inferiour to this facultie, as their end is inferiour to the end of this) haue had writers which with so great dilligence haue set forth whatsoeuer seemed necessarie vnto the perfection of them, euen from the first beginning vntill the latter ending, how much more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient were it that the like diligence shuld not bee wanting in this heauenly professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which as it is of higher dignitie thā all other professions, so is it a harder mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to apprehend it exactly, and therefore hath more need to bee set forth and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of. Now this is the thing (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) which I haue so many yeares desired: to wit, to see some booke that should treat particularly how to forme a perfect Christian, &amp; that might containe a briefe some of all such things as doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto the profession of this heauē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9371:16"/> life. For like as good Artificers doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to haue all such tooles and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as belong to their occupation, and as those that studie any Arte or Science doe seeke to haue some booke wherein is contained whatsoeuer concerneth that sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that hauing ech thing set in order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place, their memory might the lesse be distracted, euen some thought it was very requisite to doe the like in this profession, which is the Arte of Artes, and Science of Sciences: to the ende that all such as desire to serue almighty God (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this commoditie readie framed to their hands) might very easlie finde out an instruction and light, to direct their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and that the Ghostly Fathers, &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Preachers, which are zealous of the Christian common weale, might also haue without any great charge whether to referre their ghostly children, and hearers, and such as come vnto them for counsell, to vnderstand whatsoeuer belongeth to their profession.</p>
            <p>I knowe this right well that there want not for this purpose at this daie a number of books which doe conteine verie sound and Catholique doctrine: howbeit for the greater part of thē they do attend to some
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9371:17"/> one particuler matter and will not binde them selues to treate in a small volume of all such matters as doe concerne a perfect christian life. And albeit that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Catechismes (which are sommes or abridgements of the Christian Doctrine) doe treat of euerie thinge that appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the same, yet for so much as these haue respecte to declare the substance of thinges, and such as belong to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thereof, the doctrine of such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techismes apperteineth rather to specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to practise: I meane hereby, that such doctrine tendeth rather to giue light to the vnderstanding than to moue the will vnto the exercise &amp; vse of vertue.</p>
            <p>Now for this cause I haue determined with the grace of god and helpe of the writings of the Holy Fathers, who in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers partes of their writinges haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all these argumentes, together out of them all this booke, wherin is treated of al these matters.<note place="margin">What the intention of the Author is in this booke.</note> In which booke I meane to forme a perfecte christian, trayning him throughout the passages and exercises of this life, euen frō the beginning of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion vntil he come vnto the end of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And in doing this I make account that I take it in hand so rough, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9371:17"/> as if one should hewe it downe in the wood with his boughes and barke, and should beginne to labour vpon it by litle and litle vntill he bring it vnto his due perfection. For the performance wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, in the firste treatise<note place="margin">The first Treatise.</note> I set before him paradise, and hell, and the greate bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which doe accompanie vertue: and withall the boūden dutie he oweth to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the same, that by this meane he may be induced to make a firme determination with him selfe to forsake sin, and returne vnto the seruice of his Lord, and creator. Afterwardes presupposing this resolute determination in him, forsomuch as the entrie vnto this waie is by the Sacrament of pennance, I teach him in the second treatise<note place="margin">The second Treatise.</note> after what sort he ought to do pē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for his sins: wher are set forth many considerations, and praiers, that serue to moue him to an earnest sorow and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of the sins &amp; offences of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life. And there is also an instruction to teach him how to confesse him selfe of them, and how to satisfie almyghty God with due satisfaction. After confession, ther followeth the receuing of the most blessed sacrament of the Aulter, &amp; so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth immediatly the third treatise,<note place="margin">The third Treatise.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9371:18"/> he is taught after what sort he ought to prepare himselfe to communicate worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what things are requisite thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with prayers also which are to be said both before and after hee hath receaued the most blessed Sacrament. When hee hath receaued these SACRAMENTES, it followeth forth with that he doe amend his life: and therefore I haue adioyned the fourth treatise,<note place="margin">The fourth Treatise.</note> which handleth the same matter: And forsomuch as there be some Christians that content them-selues with dooing only that which is of necessitie to be done for their saluation: &amp; some others also that will passe more forward, &amp; walke to perfection, (the which persons not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented with the charge of the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, will lay moreouer vpon thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues another charge of such thinges as are taught in the gospell by way of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell only,) therfore I haue set forth in that treatise two rules of good life, the one is commō for the first sort, the other is strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more spirituall for the other sorte. And because no man can eyther beginne or perseuer in good life without the helpe of the grace of God, the which is obtained by meanes of prayer, therefore I haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the instructions &amp; rules of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9371:18"/> good life treated of praier. Now whereas there bee two kindes of prayer, the one which is pronounced with the voice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>vocall prayer:</hi> the other which is conceaued in the minde, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>mentall prayer:</hi> of the first I haue treated in the fifth treatise,<note place="margin">The fifth treatise.</note> where are set out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vocall prayers seruing for diuers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and vses of a Christian mans life: and there are also declared the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to a good prayer: but of the second kinde, which is <hi>mentall prayer,</hi> I haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the sixt treatise,<note place="margin">The sixth treatise.</note> where I treate onely of the matter of this kind of prayer, which is the consideration of the principall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the life of our Sauiour Christ, &amp; of the benifits of Almighty God: For as touching the rest that appertaineth to this argument, we haue already treated in our <hi>booke of prayer and meditation.</hi> After all this there remayneth nothing els but to arriue vnto perfection, (the which consisteth in the loue of God)<note place="margin">The perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a christian consisteth in the loue of God.</note> and of this I haue treated in the seauenth and last treatise,<note place="margin">The seauēth Treatise.</note> wherein all such things are declared as serue to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this supreame vertue, as those also which doe hinder it. And there be more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer set forth certaine considerations, and praiers, wherein he ought to exercise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9371:19"/> for the obtaining of the same vertue.</p>
            <p>This is now Christian reader the course of all the Christian life, deuided into theise seauen iourneis, whereunto may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced whatsoeuer this heauenly philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie teacheth vs.</p>
            <p>And for somuch as the foure first treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses do conteine doctrine cōcering things that ought to be done, and the other three that followe doe serue rather for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of praier, and of the loue of god, (the which be such thinges as a man ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to haue in his handes) I thought it good therefore to deuide this whole book into two volumes: to the ende that euerie man might alwaies carry with him in hys bosome the second volume without anie great burden, being so necessarie as it is for all times and places, and because all these matters are treated here briefly: it seemed to me very conuenient to call this booke a MEMORIALT,<note place="margin">Why this booke is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall.</note> as wherein a man vseth to write such thinges as hee hath to doe in a briefe sort. And yet the briefenes of this booke is not such, but that it containeth all such thinges as seeme necessarie for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the same.</p>
            <p>True it is, that the matter of this booke is very copious and plentifull, wherein
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9371:19"/> there be many thinges to be said, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worthy to bee committed to writing, but these many remaine for other writers. And yet in case it shall please Almightie God to prolong a little while the time of my life, (which so swiftly runneth away in post, I may thē handle more at large some parts of this booke, especially the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to good life, and the rules of good life, and the treatise of the loue of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the treatise of the life of our Sauiour Christ. And albeit, the thing wee pretend here to doe, (which is to forme a perfect Christian) bee properly the worke of the holy ghost, yet neuerthelesse like as grace excludeth not our trauaile &amp; indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, but must rather of necessity concurre therewith, euen so the inward instruction of Almighty God excludeth not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching of men,<note place="margin">

The which office particularly appertaineth vnto the Priests and Pastours of the Catholicke Church, vnto whome Almighty God referreth vs, that they should teache and informe vs in his law. And therefore among the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vestiments of the high Priestes, there was one that was called the <hi>Rationall,</hi>

And that this is the cause thereof, all the holy Scriptures doe clearely witnesse vnto vs. Almighty God sayth by the Prophet Esay: <hi>This people is not wise,</hi>

Wherfore sith there is no office (be it neuer so base) but that it needeth some rules and preceptes to haue it well and rightly discharged, how much more need hath this office, being the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of all other offices, which is to knowe how to please and serue almighty God, to obtaine the kingdome of heauen, and to preuaile against the forces &amp; wily deceites of our enemie the diuell?

How shall hee knowe which way to order hys life, to obtaine vertues, and to eschew vices, if hee know not the meanes whereby he ought to seek for the one, to resist the other, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the temptations and snares of the enemie? How shall hee make any prayer that shall be fruitfull vnto him, &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with such conditions, and vertues: as be required thereunto, if hee haue not some instructiō to teach him how to pray? How shall hee obtaine the loue of God, if he know not the meanes wherby it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the impediments and lets that doe hinder him from it, and the exercises wherein he ought to exercise himselfe for the obtayning thereof? Of all this light we stand in great need for all these thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, sithence wee bring them not with vs from our mothers wombe, but wee are rather borne in such wise, that we may wel be figured by that man in the Gospel, who

And admit that wee doe at the length attaine thereunto, is there any thing in that state of life that is not very fickle, &amp; dangerous? And yet to come to so perrillous a state, by how many other perrils must wee passe by the vvay? But if I will indeuour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the friendship of Almighty God, I may haue it forth with without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay. When hee had spoken these wordes, beeing greatly troubled with the considerations of framing a new kinde of life, he cast his eyes very often vppon the booke, and read forward therein, and by reading, was altogether inwardly so chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that hee resolued fully with himselfe to forsake all worldly thinges, as soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it plainly appeared. For afterwardes when he had made an end of reading, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9371:24"/> feeling in his hart diuers and sundry vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment motions, at the length with a great sigh hee said vnto his companion.</p>
            <p>Now am I at reste and quietnes. I haue determined vtterlye to forsake all our Courtly hopes; and to giue my selfe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the seruice of Almighty God, and to remaine from henceforth in this place. If thou (my deare friend) be not minded to follow me, yet of curtesie I beseech thee goe not about to hinder me therein. The other Courtier answered, that hee coulde not forsake him, neyther would he faile to keep him company, considering that there was hope thereby of so great reward. And so these two Courtly Gentlemen began to reare vp a spirituall building with charges enough, to wit, with forsaking all thinges of this world, and only to follow Christ, &amp; that which is no lesse to bee maruailed at, both these two Courtiers had their espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to whome they were affienced in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, who so soone as they vnderstood ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, consecrated themselues vnto God, and made a vow of chastitie. This History S. Augustine telleth, and this example was of so great efficacie vnto himselfe, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the recitall thereof being meruailously mooued therewith, hee cryed out vnto a hard
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9371:24"/> certaine familiar friend of his saying: what doe wee? What is this vvhich thou haste heard. The ignorant rise vp, and steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way heauen from vs, and wee with all our great learning and knowledge, goe vp and downe drowned in flesh and blood. And being in this alteration, and inward griefe, the holy man Saint Augustine saith, that he went into a garden, which he had neare vnto that place, where hee caste himselfe downe vnderneath a figge tree, and with much weeping, and trouble of minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cry out, saying.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 6.</note> And thou O Lord how long? how long wilt thou bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me? shall thine anger neuer haue an end?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 87.</note> Remember not O Lord our olde iniquities! And hee repeated very often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time these wordes: how long O Lorde! how long! To morrow, and why not euen now out of hand? Wherefore shall not mine vncleannesse haue an end this day? And in saying these words with great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of minde, hee heard a voice that said: Take, read: take, read. And with that he saieth that hee rose vp to take a Holie booke, that lay by him to read therevpon. For hee had heard tell of the same S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony, how he hearing the Ghospell read, which saith.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> then beeing mooued with this example, but rather with the voice which he had heard, saith that he tooke the booke, and began to read in it. And almighty God powred there so great a light of grace into him, that he forsooke all that euer he had in the world, and gaue himselfe wholly vnto the seruice of Almighty God. All this Saint Augustine writeth in his eight booke of Confessions: whereby yee may see how many notable conuersions euen of famous holy men haue had their first beginning by reading of holy bookes. As here ye see the conuersion of those friendes of Potiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, and the conuersion of blessed S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, and the conuersion of the same S. Anthonie, vnto the which also might be ioyned many other conuersions, as well of such as are past, as of such as bee presentlie aliue at this day: the which had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the very same cause. But I leaue the rehearsall of these for breuities
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9371:25"/> sake. For vndoubtedly the misteries which the Christian religion setteth forth vnto men are such, &amp; so great, and of such force to moue their hearts, that I meruaile no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, if they make so great changes and alterations in such persons, as do with attention consider them. And this read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holy bookes helpeth not only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake such as are a sleepe in sinne, (as yee haue seene here before, (but also to keepe such as are already awaked from sleeping And therefore the word of God is called in all the holy Scriptures bread, or foode,<note place="margin">The word of God is called bread or food.</note> because it sustaineth and preserueth our soules in the spirituall life,<note place="margin">

            <p>And albeit that this spirituall food hath beene at all times very necessary (as the breade of our life) yet is it much more needfull now in these our corrupt dayes. For in old time in the Primitiue Church, the Priestes and Curates were so feruent and carefull in preaching of the worde of God, that that might suffice to preserue &amp; increase the faithful people in vertue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other reading: but now alas, the Priestes, and euen such as haue cure of soules, doe beleeue that they are bound to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9371:26"/> nothing els, but onely to minister the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and to say a Masse at their time appointed, &amp; herewith they content them selues for the moste part in villages, and townes,<note place="margin">Both townes and Citties haue in this our corrupt age to many lewd bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: but the Author complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the great wante of good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Preachers.</note> yea, and in some populous Citties also. Wherefore the greater the want is that we haue at this daie in this behalfe, the greater neede wee haue to supplie the want of good Catholicke Pastors and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, with good and deuout bookes.</p>
            <p>Take therefore good Christian reader, this small present, the which may in a little volume, and with a small charge supply in part this defect. For it may serue thee for a Preacher, to exhort thee vnto good life, for an instruction, to teach thee howe to lead a good life: for a confessionall, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thee, how thou oughtest to confesse thy sinnes, and to make due preparation, when thou intendest to communicate, and receaue the most blessed Sacrament of the Aultar: It may serue also for a booke of deuotion, wherein thou mayest exercise thy selfe in praier, &amp; it giueth thee moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer abundance of matter for meditation: in which pointes are comprehended the some of Christian Philosophie. And if this Memoriall be worthy of commendation, it is for that it containeth matters so vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9371:26"/> that it treateth of all such thinges as doe appertaine to all Christians whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be, aswell to the beginners, as to those that haue proceeded further in the spirituall life, and are come to some perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And if the fruit that shall be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereof, shalbe so great as my diligence and trauile hath bin in gathering all these matters together, &amp; in setting them forth in so plaine and easie a stile, to prouoke the appetites of such as are weake (vnto whom sometimes I direct my speech) I shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all my labour and paines to be very well employed.

And for this end hee commaunded the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that he should take a white booke, &amp; write in the same all the threatninges, and calamities, which hee had reuealed vnto him, euen from the first day hee began to talke with him, vntill that present houre, and that hee should read the same in the presence of all the people, to see if peraduenture they would bee mooued therewith to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9371:28"/> and to chaunge their former life, to the end that he might also change the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his wrath, which hee had purposed to execute vpon them. And the Holy Scripture saith, that when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had done according as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by almighty God, and had read all those threatnings in the presence of the people, and of the rulers, there arose such a feare and terrour among them, that they were all astonished, and as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straught of their wits, looking one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers face, for the exceeding great feare which they had conceiued of those words.</p>
               <p>This was one of the principall meanes that almightie God vsed with men in the time of the lawe written, &amp; so did he also in the time of the law of Grace: In which the holie Apostle saith, that as there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed a iustice whereby God maketh men iuste,<note place="margin">

For which cause <hi>Saint Iohn Baptist,</hi> the glorious forerunner of our Sauiour Christe, was sente with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, &amp; ambassage, to preach vnto the worlde,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>verse.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.9.</note>
                  <hi>that the axe was now put to the roote of the tree, and that euerie tree that brought not forth good fruite should be cut downe, and cast
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9371:29"/> into the fire.</hi> He saide moreouer, <hi>that there was an other come into the world more mightie than he, that caried in his hand a fanne, to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowe and cleanse therwith his flower, &amp; that he would put vp the corne into his granard, but the chaffe he would burne in a fier that shuld neuer be quenched.</hi> This was the preaching and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage which the holie forerunner of our Sauiour Christe brought into the worlde. And so great was the thunder of these wordes, and the terror which entred into mens hartes so dreadfull, that there ranne vnto him of all states and conditions of men euen of the verie Pharises, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, yea and Souldiars also, (which of all others are wont to bee most dissolute, and to haue least care of their consciēces,) and eche of them for himselfe demaunded particularlie of that holie man, what he should doe to attaine vnto saluation, and to escape those terrible threatnings which he had denounced vnto them: so great was the feare they had conceiued of them.</p>
               <p>Now this is that (my deare christian brother) which I do at this present in the behalfe of Almightie God preach vnto thee although not with such feruencie of spirite, &amp; like holines of life, yet that which importeth more to this case) with the same

As taking an example of the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of our bodie, we see that one hath a disease in his eies, an other in his eares, one is sicke in his hart, an other in his stomake, some other in his head, and so diuers men are diseased in diuers parts, howbeit in such wise, that none of all these diseases be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally throughout all the members of the

Now let vs put the case, that there were some one man sicke of such an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall disease, that hee had no part of his body, neyther any one ioynt or sence free from his proper griefe, and torment: but that at one time and instant hee suffered most exceeding sharpe paines in his head, in his eyes and eares, in his teeth and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, in his liuer and heart, (to bee short) in all the rest of the members and ioyntes of the body, and that he lay after this sort stretching himselfe in his bed, pained with these griefes and torments, euery member of his body hauing his particuler torment, he I say, that should lie thus pained and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, howe great torment and griefe of minde (thinke yee) should he sustaine?

O how much worth would that bee vnto vs at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which then we despised and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?

O yee infernall furies, come and rent mee in peeces, and deuoure these my bowels, for so haue I iustly deserued!

                  <p>THOV wilt peraduenture bee ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed (good Christian Reader) in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so many kind of paines in hel, as haue bin here described. And now thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that there can bee added vnto this no more than hath bin said. But surely the mighty arme of God wanteth not force to chastice his enemies more, and more. For all these paines that wee haue hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, are such as doe appertaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all the damned: but besides these generall paines,<note place="margin">The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paines of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> there are also other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paines, which each one of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned shall there suffer in diuerse sort, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the qualitie of his sinne. And so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this proportion, the haughty &amp; proud<note place="margin">The proude.</note> shall there bee abased and brought low to their great confusion. The couetous<note place="margin">The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</note> shall be driuen to miserable necessity. The glutton<note place="margin">The glot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> shall rage with continuall hunger, and thirste. The leacherous<note place="margin">The lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous.</note> shall burne in the very same flames which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue enkindled, and those that haue all their lifetime hunted after their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and pastimes, shall liue there in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall lamentation and sorrow.</p>
                  <p>But because examples are of very great
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9371:40"/> force to moue our harts, I will bring onely one for this purpose, wherby somewhat of this matter may the better be perceaued.</p>
                  <p>It is written of a certaine holy man, that he saw in spirit the paines of a licentious &amp; worldly man in this sort. First,<note place="margin">The paines of hell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to a Holy man</note> he saw how the diuels that were present at the houre of his death when he yeelded vp his ghost, snatched away his soule with great reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and made a present thereof vnto the Prince of darkenes, who was then sitting in a great chaire of fire, looking for the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this present. Immediatlie after that it was presented before him, hee arose out of his seate, and said vnto the damned soule, that hee would giue him the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of that honourable seat, because he had beene a man of honour, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies very much affected towardes the same. Incontinently after that he was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therein, crying, and lamenting in that honourable torment, there appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him two other most vglie diuels, and offred him a cuppe full of most bitter and stincking licour, and made him to drinke and carouse it vp all perforce, saying: it is meet sithence thou hast bin a louer of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wines, and bankets, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest likewise proue of this wine, whereof
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9371:41"/> all we doe vse to drinke in these parts. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after this, there came other two, with two fierie trumpets, and setting them at his eares, began to blow into thē flames of fire: saying, this melodie haue we reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for thee, vnderstanding that in the world thou haste very much delited with minstrelsie, and wanton Songes. And so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely he espied other diuels, loden with vipers, and serpents, the which they threw vpon the breast and bellie of that misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinner, saying vnto him, that for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he had bin greatly delighted with the wanton embracings &amp; lecherous lusts of women, he should now solace himselfe with these refreshings, in steed of those li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious delites &amp; pleasures, which he had enioyed in the world. After this sort (as the Prophet Esay saith) when the sinner is punished,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esay.</hi> 47.</note> there is giuen measure, for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to the end that in such a great variety and proportion of punishments, the order and wisedome of Gods iustice might the more manifestly appeare.</p>
                  <p>This vision hath almighty God shewed in spirit to this Holy man for our aduertis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and instruction, not that in hel these thinges are altogether so materially done, but that by them we might in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9371:41"/> vnderstand somewhat of the varietie and multitude of the paines, which bee there appointed for the damned. Whereof I know not how some of the Pagans haue had a certaine knowledge: for a Poet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this multitude of paines, affirmed, that although he had a hundred mouthes, &amp; as many tongues, with a voice as strong as iron, yet were they not able to expresse the names only of thē. A Poet he was that spake this, but truely therein hee spake not like a poet, but like a Prophet &amp; Euāgilist.</p>
                  <p>Now then if all this shall assuredly so come to passe, what man is he that seeing all this so certainely with the eyes of his faith, will not turne ouer the leafe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to prouide for himselfe against that time? Where is the iudgment of men now become? Where be their wits? Where is at the least their selfe loue, which seeketh euermore for his owne profit, and is much afraide of any losse? What may it bee thought that men are become beastes, that prouide only for the time present? or haue they peraduenture so dimmed their eye-sight, that they cannot look before them? Harken saith Esaie, O yee deafe, and yee blind, opē your eies that you may see?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esay.</hi> 42.</note> who is blind but my seruant? And who is deafe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9371:42"/> but ye vnto whome I haue sent my mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers? And who is blind but he that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himselfe to be sold for a slaue? Thou that seest so many things wilt thou not see this? Thou that haste thine eares open, wilt thou not giue eare hereunto? If thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not this, how art thou a Christian? If thou beleeue it, and doest not prouide for it, how canst thou be thought a reasonable man?<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene an opinion &amp; imaginatiō.</note>
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene an opinion, and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that an imagination alone is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to cause a feare, but an opinion is: For if I doe imagine that a house may fall vpon me, it is not enough to make mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, vnlesse I beleeue or haue an opinion that it will bee so indeed: for then it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make mee afraide. And hereof commeth the feare that murderers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue, by reason of the suspition they conceaue at their enemies that then doe lie in waite for them. If then the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and only suspition of danger is able to cause the moste valiant and couragious to feare, how is it that the certaintie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of so many and so great tirrible mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which is farre more suer than any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or knowledge, doth not make thee to feare. If thou perceauest that for these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9371:42"/> yeares past thou hast led a licentious &amp; sinfull life, and that at the least according to present iustice thou art condemned to these horrible torments in hell: If I may also probably coniecture, that there is no more likelihood of the amendment of thy life to come, than thou haste shewed he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto after so many yeares past, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it, that running headlong forwardes into so manifest a danger thou art nothing at all afraid? Especially cōsidering the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full state wherein thou liuest, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible paines and tormentes, which doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for thee, and the time that thou haste lost, and the endles repentance which thou shalt haue therefore in the moste horrible torments of hell. Assuredly it passeth all cōmon sence to consider that there should be such wilfull grosse blindnes in men.</p>

               <p>TO THE end there might want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to stir vp our mindes vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, after the paines which Almighty God threatneth vnto the wicked, hee doth also set before vs the rewarde of the good.

Howbeit that wee may haue some kinde of sauour, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, I intend to rehearse here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen word for word, what S. Augustine sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in one of his meditations, speaking of this life.<note place="margin">S. August. medita. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> O life (saith he) prepared by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for his friendes, a blessed life, a secure life, a quiet life, a beautifull life, a cleane life, a chaste life, a holy life, a life that knoweth no death, a life without sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, without labour, without griefe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble, without corruption, without feare, without variety, without alteration, a life replenished with all beautie, &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, where there is neither enimy that can offend, nor delghte that can annoy, where loue is perfit, and no feare at all, where the day is euerlasting, &amp; the spirit of all is one, where almighty God is seene face to face, who is the onely meate whereuppon they feed without any loathsomnesse. It delit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me to consider thy brightnesse, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9371:43"/> thy treasures do reioyce my longing hart. The more I consider thee, the more I am striken in loue with thee. The great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire I haue of thee, doth wonderfullie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light mee, and no lesse pleasure it is vnto mee, to keepe thee in my remembrance. O life most happie! O Kingdome moste truelie blessed! where there is no death nor ende, neyther yet succession of time: where the daie continuing euermore with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out night, knoweth not any mutatiō: wher the victorious conquerour beeing ioyned with those euerlasting quiers of Angelles, and hauing his head Crowned with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of glorie singeth vnto Almighty God one of the Songes of Sion!

                  </note> if when the race of this my Pilgrimage is ended, I might be worthy to see thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, thy blessednesse, thy beautie, the wals, and Gates of thy Cittie, thy Streetes, thy lodginges, the noble Cittizens, and thine Omnipotent KING in his most glorious Maiestie. The stones of thy walles are precious. Thy gates are adorned with bright Pearles. Thy streetes are of verie fine excellent gold, in which there neuer faile perpetuall praises. Thy houses are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with rich stones, wrought throughout
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9371:44"/> with zaphiries, and couered aboue with massie gold: where none entreth in that is not cleane, neyther doth any abide there that is defiled. Faire and beautifull in thy delightes art thou O Ierusalem our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! None of those things are suffered in thee, that are suffered here. There is great diuersity betweene thy thinges, and the thinges that we doe continually see in this miserable life. In thee is neuer seene ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther darkenes, nor night, neyther yet any change of time. The light that shineth in thee commeth neyther of Lamps, nor of the Moone, nor yet of the bright glistering Starres, but God that proceedeth of God, and the light that commeth of light is hee that giueth clearenes vnto thee. Euen the very king of kinges himselfe keepeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall residence in the middest of thee, compassed about with his officers and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. There doe the Angels in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and quiers sing a most sweet &amp; melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious harmonie. There is celebrated a perpetuall solemnity and feast, with euery one that commeth thither, after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this pilgrimage. There be the orders of Prophetes.<note place="margin">The blessed company of Heauen.</note> There is the famous company of the Apostles. There is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible Army of Martyrs. There is the

There are the holy Virgins which haue ouercome both the pleasures of the world, and the frailtie of their own nature. There are the young men and young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, more ancient in vertue, thā in yeres. There are the sheepe, &amp; little lambes, that haue escaped from the Wolues, and from the deceitfull snares of this life. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe now keepe a perpetuall feast each one in his place, all alike in ioy, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in degree. There Charitie raigneth in her full perfection.

O happy were I, yea and very happy indeed, if at what time I shall be loosed out of the prison of this wretched body, I might bee thought worthy to heare those Songes of that heauenly melody, song in the praise of the euerlasting King by all the cittizens of that so noble citty!

               <p>Now tell mee (good Christian reader,) what a day shall that bee, that shall shine in thy house, (if thou leade thy life in the feare of God,) when after the course of this Pilgrimage, thou shalt passe frō death to immortalitie, and in that passage when others shall begin to feare, thou shalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reioyce, &amp; lift vp thy head, because the day of thy deliuerāce is at hand.

O how great ioy shalt thou receaue at that time for all the good workes that thou haste done? How clearely shalt thou there vnderstand the value and excellencie of vertue? There the obedient man shall talk of victories. There vertue shall receaue her rewarde, and the good shall be honored according to their merite. Moreouer, what a pleasure will it be vnto thee, when thou shalt see thy selfe to bee in that sure hauen, and shalt looke vpon the course of thy nauigation, which thou hast sailed here in this life: whē thou shalt remember the Tempestes wherein thou hast bin tossed, the streights through which thou hast passed, and the daungers of Theeues, and Pirates, from whom thou haste escaped?

Besides al this, what a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sight shall it be to behold the feastes, &amp; triumphes, which they dayly celebrate with their new brethren, who hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the world, and finished the course of their Pilgrimage, doe enter in there to be crowned with them! O what a ioy will it be to see those seates filled vp, and that citty builded, and the walles of that noble Ierusalem repaired againe! With what chearefull embracinges shall the whole Court of heauen entertaine them, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them when they come loaden with the spoyles of their vāquished enemie! There shall those valiant men and women enter with triumph, which haue together with the world cōquered the weakenes of their owne fraile nature. There shall the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Virgins enter, which haue suffered Martirdome for Christs sake, with double triumph ouer the flesh, and the worlde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned also with garlands of lillies, &amp; roses vpon their heades. There shall also enter dayly many young men, and children, which haue vanquished the tendernes of

There shall they acknowledge their Masters. There shall they knowe their Parentes, and embrace one another with sweet and friendly kisses, and reioice with them at their glorious entrie and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. O how sweete and sauorie shall the fruit of vertue then be, although for a time before, her rootes seemed very bitter! Sweet is the colde Euening after the hotte sunnie day: sweete is the fountaine to the wearie trauailer: sweet is rest and sleepe to the tyred seruant: but much more sweet is it to the Saintes in heauen, to inioy peace after war, securitie after perill, eternall rest after their paines, and trauailes. For then are the warres at an end. Then need they no more to goe al armed both on the right and on the left side.

Well to satisfie thee herein, wee will likewise giue thee heere thy hands full euen of this thou doest to earnestlie desire. For although our Lorde doe reserue the best wine, and the moste delicate dishes vntill the end of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: yet he suffereth not his friendes to be vtterly destitute of meate and drinke in this tedious voiage.

These haue bin thy gods, these haue bin thy Idols, whome thou haste serued, and whose lawes thou haste diligentlie obeyed. Make thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with Almighty God, with his lawes and with his obedience, and peraduenture thou shalt finde, that thou haste esteemed him no more than if hee had bin a God of straw. For it is certaine, that there be many Christians, which beleeuing that there is a God, are induced to sinne with such faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as though they beleeued that there were no God at all, &amp; doe offend no whit lesse though they beleeue that there is a God, than they would doe if they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that there were none at all. What greater iniurie, what greater despite can there be done, than thus to contemne his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9371:55"/> diuine Maiestie? Finally, thou beleeuing all such thinges as Christes Catholicke Church doth beleeue, hast notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so led thy life, as if thou were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the beleefe of the christians were the greatest fables or lies in the world.</p>
               <p>And if the multitude of thy sinnes past, &amp; the facilitie that thou hast vsed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them doe not make thee afraide, why doest thou not feare at the least the Maiestie &amp; Omnipotencie of him, against whome thou haste sinned?

This faith telleth thee, that thou hast a iudge aboue, that seeth all the steps and motions of thy life:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. <hi>verse.</hi> 36.</note> And that certainelie there shall a day come, when hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an account of thee, euen of euerie idle word. This faith teacheth thee, that a man is not altogether at an end when hee dieth, but that after this temporall life, there remaineth an other euerlasting life, &amp; that the soules die not with the bodies, but that whiles the body remaineth in the graue vntill the general daie of iudgment, the soule shall enter into another new coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and into a new world, where it shall haue such habitation, and companie as the faith and workes were, which it had in this life. This faith telleth thee also, that both
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9371:58"/> the reward of vertue, and the punishment of vice, is a thing so wonderfull, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the whole world wer full of books, and all creatures were writers, yet should they all be wearied, and the world come to an end, before they should end their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and make a perfect declaration what is comprehended in ech one of these pointes. This faith informeth thee also, that the debtes and duties which wee owe vnto almighty God are so great, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it a man had so many liues as there bee sandes in the sea, yet would they not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, if they were all employed in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. And this faith likewise telleth thee, that vertue is such an excellent treasure, that all the treasures of the world, &amp; that mans heart can desire, are not to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if there bee so many and so great respects that doe inuite vs vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, how commeth it to passe that there be so few louers and followers of the same? If men be mooued with gaine, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, what greater commoditie can there bee, then life euerlasting? If with feare of punishment, what punishment can be gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than euerlasting horrible torments in hell fire, vvorld vvithout ende? If vvith

If the feare of perils doe moue vs, what greater perrill can there bee than death, the houre thereof beeing so vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and the account so strait? If thou be mooued with peace, libertie, quietnesse of minde, and with a pleasant life, (which are things that all the world desireth) it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that all these are found much better in the life that is gouerned by vertue and reason, than in that life, that is ruled by the affections, and passions of the minde: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as man is a reasonable creature, &amp; no beast Howbeit in case thou account all this as not sufficient to mooue thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, yet shall it not suffice thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that Almightie God so abased him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for thy sake, that hee descended from heauen vnto the earth, and became man? And whereas he created the world in sixe daies, he bestowed thirtie and three yeares about thy Redemption, yea and was also content for the same to loose his life. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God died that sin should die, and yet for all this doe we endeuour that sinne might liue in our hearts, notwithstanding
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:9371:59"/> that Almightie God purposed to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the life of sinne with his owne death? What shal I say more? Assuredly of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons we haue shewed enough, &amp; enough, if this matter were to be discussed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: For I say this, not onely in beholding almightie God himselfe vpon the Crosse, but whithersoeuer we turne our eyes, wee shall finde that euery thing crieth out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and calleth vppon vs to receaue this so excellent a benefit: For there is not a thing created in the world, (if we doe well consider it,) but doth inuite vs to the loue and seruice of our common Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Insomuch that looke how manie creatures there bee in the world, so manie preachers there are, so many books, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny voices, and so many reasons, which doe call vs vnto almighty God.

What might Almightie God haue done more than hee hath done, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more than he hath promised, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more than he hath threatned, to draw vs vnto him, &amp; to pluck vs away from sin, &amp; yet al this notwitstanding, how cōmeth it to passe that there is so great (I will not

Iohn. <hi>3.5.</hi> Luke. <hi>13.3.</hi> Mat. <hi>4.17.</hi> Mar. <hi>1.15.</hi>
                  </note>And here it is diligently to be noted, that like as none can attaine vnto saluation without the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptisme, (either in act, or at least wise hauing a will, and desire therof, when he wanteth meanes, and opportunitie to receaue it:) euen so no christian committing any deadlie sinne after baptisme can attaine vnto saluation without the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of pennance, (either in act, or at least wise hauing a will and desire vnto it, when he cānot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie performe all the partes of it.) And so it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the holie scriptures, that our Sauiour Christ hath comaunded these two sacraments (of baptisme and pennance,) with like bond of necessitie, and with like threatning and penaltie of euerlasting damnation. For as he said in <hi>S.</hi> Iohn of the sacramēt of baptisme. <hi>vnlesse a man be borne againe of water, &amp; and the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God</hi> euen so likewise hath he said in the ghospell of S. Luke of the sacrament of pennance, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed afterwards to institute: <hi>vnlesse ye haue pēnance yee shall all likewise perish.</hi> And also in the ghospell of Saint Mathew he saith: <hi>doe pennace, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is at hand.</hi> And moreouer it appereth in the ghospell of Saint Marke, that he beganne his preaching vnto the people with requiring them to be penitent for their sinnes saing, <hi>be penitent, &amp; beleue the gospell:</hi> wherby our Sauiour Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto them both these two points equallie as a necessarie precept: to wit, to bee penitent for their sins: and to beleue the ghospell.</p>
               <p>Now forsomuch as a man sinneth against almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God in three manner of waies, that is to say, with his hart, with his tongue, and with his wotkes,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9371:66"/> therefore against these three manner of sins our, Lord hath ordeined the sacrament of pennance: which conteineth in it three principall parts: to wit, contrition,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Contritiō.</hi>

               <p>AMONG all the euils that are at this day raigning in the world, there is none more to be lamented, than the manner that manie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians doe vse in making their Confession of their sinnes, at such time as our holy mother the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church commandeth the same.

Whereupon it ensueth, that so soone as they haue
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9371:67"/> made their confession, and communicated, they returne agaime immediatly vnto their accustomed wicked life, &amp; scarcely is the holy Passion weeke of pennance fullie ended, but they returne againe out of hand vnto the same filth, wherein they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed themselues before, and so they returne back againe,<note place="margin">

This is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly a great contempt of almighty God, of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, and of his Priestes and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and it seemeth that they vse it as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary custome to goe once euery yeare at Easter to dallie, and mocke with almighty God, for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him at that time of pardon for all such sinnes &amp; offences, as they haue before committed against him, and doe protest an amendment of their life, &amp; yet doe they out of hand beginne a fresh to offende him more grieuously than before.</p>
               <p>The punishment that these persons do deserue, is euen such as almightie God ordeineth for them, which is the greatest that can be deuised: &amp; that is, to suffer them to mocke on after this sort all the daies of their life, euen vntill the houre of theyr death, &amp; then it hapneth vnto them, as it is wont to those that haue neuer done true pennance vntil that time, the end of whom (to speake ordinarily) shall be as the Apostle saith, according to their workes,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> for which they neuer did true Pennance, but alwaies false and counterfeit Pennance.

For this is one of the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious sacrifices that wee are able to offer vnto Almightie GOD, according as the Prophet Dauid saith: <hi>A sorrowfmll minde is a Sacrifice vnto God, and a contrite and humble hart thou O Lord wilt not despise!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Contrition conteineth two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall partes. The one is a Repentance for the sinnes past, and the other is a firme &amp; determinate purpose of amendment in time to come.<note place="margin">What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is.</note> The reasō hereof is, because Contritiō (to speake properly) is a detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:9371:68"/> &amp; abhorring of sinne aboue all things that may be hated, &amp; abhorred, in regard that it offendeth the Maiestie of almighty God. And therefore hee that conceaueth this so earnest detestation and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, doth as well abhorre the sins past, as those that are to come, because his diuine Maiestie is offended both with the one, and with the other:<note place="margin">We must be sorrowfull for our sins past: &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew them hereafter. S. August.</note> But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the sins past, (sithence they are done, and cannot be recalled,) hee must sorrow &amp; lament, that hee hath committed them. And for such sinnes as may come hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (which are in his own free will &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,) hee must make a full and constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination with himselfe to eschew, and auoide them. Wherby it appeareth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that (as <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> saith in his book of the medecine of Pennance) it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a man to please God by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his former sinfull life, and by auoyding in time to come the sinnes past, but it is very needfull also, that he make SATIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FACTION for them with the sorrowe of Pennance, with the bewailing of humility, with the Sacrifice of a contrite &amp; humble hart, and with the workes of mercie.</p>
                  <p>And so according hereūto, the first thing that a true penitent ought to procure, is to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:9371:69"/> haue sorrow and repentance for his sinnes, dooing the same, that the holy Penitent did,<note place="margin">Esaie. <hi>38.</hi> verse. <hi>15.</hi> Note for what cause a mā should principallie bee sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his sinnes.</note> who said: <hi>I will call to minde before thee all the yeares of my life, in the bitternes of my soule.</hi> And this sorrow and bitternesse ought not principallie to be, for that by his sinnes he hath deserued hell, &amp; lost heauen, with all other benefits which are lost thereby, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to bee sorrowfull for this cause bee good also:) but for that by his sinnes hee hath lost almightie God, and hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him most grieuouslie. And as almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty god deserueth to be loued &amp; esteemed aboue al things: euen so reason would that we should bee more grieued for the losse of him in the world, &amp; for offending him, than for all other thinges in the world. For the greater the offēce is, the greater griefe is required, and the greatest losse ought most of all to bee lamented. True it is, that the mercy of our Lord, and the desire he hath of our saluatiō is so great, that though the griefe and sorrow bee not fully answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the sinne committed if it bee bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced after this sort, yet the verrue of the Sacrament of Pennance beeing ioyned therewith, (which giueth grace to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauer, in case there be found none impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in him to hinder the same,) shall

                  <p>Here it is likewise to bee noted for the comfort of the weake, and scrupulous, that this sorrow and griefe for sin, which is here required, is not so of necessitie, that it bee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:9371:70"/> alwaies as other sensible griefes are (which are in the sensible part of our soule,<note place="margin">S. Bonauen. in <hi>4.</hi> sent. dist. <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> &amp; are afterwards resolued into teares:) for there may be true repentance &amp; sorow of minde without any such outward show, when our will detesteth and abhorreth sin aboue all thinges that may be detested and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The which earnest detestation of sin is often times conceaued of penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners without weeping, &amp; without this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manner of sorrow: but how and by what meanes this kinde of repentance and sorrow for sinne ought to bee procured, it shall bee declared hereafter in his proper place.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A penitent must haue a firme deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination neuer to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting anie deadly sin. The loue of God must be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cause to mooue vs to forsake sinne.</note>The second part (&amp; very principall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so) which is requisite vnto this contrition, is to haue a firme and resolute purpose ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to offend Almightie God any more in any thing that is a deadly sinne. And this resolution likewise (as I said before of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe) must not be principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended eyther for heauen, or hell, or else for any other peculiar interest or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of our owne, but for the loue of God. As wee see that the honest wife purposeth fullie in her minde rather to die a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand deathes, than she will once consent to breake her promise, and faith, which shee
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9371:70"/> oweth vnto her husband. And this shee doth, not so much for feare of punishment or for hope of commodity, which she look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for at his hands, as for the pure loue she beareth vnto him. And yet neuerthelesse it must needs be granted that to feare hell, or to desire heauen, are not to bee reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but are very profitable, and laudable, yea and a gift of God also.</p>
                  <p>And as a man is bounde to haue a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute purpose, &amp; intent,<note place="margin">The peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent muste intend to forsake his old deadlie sins, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and the absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priest bee nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable vnto him.</note> to eschew all dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinnes that are to come, so is it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie also, that he seperate himselfe from his present sinnes, and doe forsake them, if they bee deadly sinnes: for otherwise his confession should bee no confesion, but a Sacriledge, and an iniurie vnto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so consequently both hee that confesseth, and the priest that giueth him absolutiō, shuld be both giltie of sacrilege, &amp; should dishonor the sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And a confession made in this wise should not be any remission of his sins past, but a further augmentation &amp; increase of other new sins vnto them. Wherefore hee that wil not make of this medecine a poisō, nor abuse that to his own damnatiō which almighty God hath ordained for his help, &amp; remedy, let him indeuor aboue al things
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:9371:71"/> to sequester and keepe himselfe from all kinde of deadly sinne,<note place="margin">The vsurer must also leaue his v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, &amp; he that hath kept a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so leaue her, and doe so no more.</note> if he bee entangled therewith.</p>
                  <p>And therefore hee that beareth anie malice or hatred against his Neighbour, must put away his malicious minde, &amp; be hartilie reconciled vnto him, yea &amp; speake vnto him againe, if hee haue forborne the same, when it may bee feared that by not dooing thereof some notable scandale or offence may ensue therby: which must be well considered by the iudgement of the discreet Ghostly father. As for example, in case that he who did thee an iniury desired pardon of thee in the Court (as we tearme it) of conscience, and thou diddest denie it him: by this deniall thou diddest offende him, and prouoke him to conceaue malice and anger against thee. Likewise hee that withholdeth any other mans goods against the will of the owner, is bound to restore them vnto him againe forth with, &amp; mark well, that I say forthwith: for in case he be able to pay forthwith: hee is bound to pay forthwith vnto him, &amp; it is not sufficiēt to say that he purposeth to restore such goods in time to come,<note place="margin">The peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent must make resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution out of hand.</note> or to bequeath them to the true owner in his last testament, in case he be able presently to doe it: but he must

And this restitution ought to be done out of hand, and without delaie, then especially, when the right owner to whom it is due standeth in such, or like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of it himselfe. And for somuch as touching this bond of restitution or repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of hand much is to bee said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause much craft and deceit is vsed now a daies, by reason of vnwilling and naughtie restorers, therefore who so will haue a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure &amp; quiet conscience, let him aske coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile of such godlie and learned men, as are able to direct him safely from such dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deceits. He must also vnderstand, that not onlie he that stole or embeseled goods awaie is bound to restitution, but euen he also, that was the occasion thereof, eyther by accompanying, counsayling, consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by receiuing the malefactor as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor into his house, or by bying of anie suspected person, or by receiuing such into his house, or els by not resisting and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the damage that was done, beeing such a person, as both ought &amp; might haue done it: for all these &amp; euery one of them are bounde to make restitution <hi>in solidum,</hi>

                     <hi>Peraduenture it is a greater miracle for a man to dwell with a woman,</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9371:73"/> that cannot be cured but, with iron &amp; fire, by cutting awaie sometimes one member to saue all the rest of the body: euen so I confesse, that there are some spirituall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases that cannot otherwise be healed, but with such like sharp medecines as these be. And therein the law of God is not to bee blamed, (which is most iust &amp; sweet,) but thou thy selfe, that haste broken the veile of shamefastnes, and haste opened a gappe to sin and wickednes, and haste prouoked a wilde raging beast, which was inclosed within her owne denne, where thou haste no feet to flie away, nor place to retire thy selfe: and therefore it skilleth not, if thou doe now pay that thou hast deserued, and gather fruite according to the seede thou hast sowē: It skilleth not I say, if thou take some great paine to driue awaie thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie out of thy house, sith thou thy selfe haste opened the gate, and giuen her an entrie therein.</p>
                  <p>This is that which appertaineth vnto the two principall partes of Contrition.

                  <p>HEE THEN that desireth earnestly &amp; with all his heart to obtaine this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious iewel of Contritiō, must vnderstand, that the first meane for the obtaining thereof,<note place="margin">Perfect Pennance is the gift of God.</note> is to demaunde the same of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, with all the humilitie &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie that is possible. Because for a man to repent himselfe of his sinnes as he ought to doe indeed, proceedeth of a very speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace and gift of almightie God, and is a worke that exceedeth all the power and force of mans nature, and the reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, for that the nature of man remaineth now through originall sinne out of the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes, and naturall order, in which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God created it: For hee created it vpright, and lifted vp vnto God by loue: but sinne hath crooked it, and inclined it downe to her selfe, that is vnto the loue of visible thinges, which it loueth and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more than Almighty God, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like as a mā that is borne with a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:9371:74"/> backe from his mothers wombe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde any naturall medicine, or vertue, that is able to restore him againe to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall streightnes: euen so also our will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne with this kind of deformitie, &amp; spirituall crookednes, there is nothing able to strengthen it againe, and to direct it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, by causing it to loue God aboue all thinges, but onely the same Lord that hath created it. Now then as a man cannot haue this loue of God aboue all things, but by God himselfe: so likewise can hee not haue the sorrow for sinne aboue all things for the loue of him, but by the special help of God himselfe: for somuch as of the one followeth the other. And therefore our Lord saith in the Ghospell: <hi>No man can come vnto me vnlesse my father draw him.</hi>

                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.44.</note> To come vnto Christ, is nothing els but to loue him aboue all things, &amp; to be sorrowful for our sins more than for all other thinges in the world, &amp; such loue and sorrow no man can haue of himselfe as it is requisite to be had, vnles it be giuē him by almighty god: now for almighty god to grant this benefit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a sinner, is the greatest grace, &amp; the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test benefit that he can possibly grant him. for although it be a greater benefit to giue glory thā grace: yet it is a greater matter to plucke and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:9371:75"/> help a man out of sinne, and to set him in state of grace, than after that hee is placed in grace,<note place="margin">Summa. <hi>S.</hi> Thomae. <hi>1. 2</hi> quest. <hi>113.</hi> art. <hi>9.</hi>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9371:77"/> memorie, and will, and that thou shouldest repose in him all thy loue, faith, and hope: but thou as one vnmindfull of all this, hast wholly imployed thy selfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on transitorie and base creatures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised thy creator, applying, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that vnto them, which was due vnto him alone.

In dooing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou haste giuen that vnto creatures, which appertained properly vnto the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and hast employed that vpon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges, which ought to haue beene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed vpon heauenly treasures. By this maist thou also perceaue, how lewdly thou haste fulfilled the chiefest of thy bondes: to wit, the first commandement of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, which appertaineth to this end. If thou denie this, then consider how minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thou haste beene of this Lord, in that thou haste passed ouer in a manner all thy whole life, without euer calling him to minde: how vngratefull thou haste beene for his benefits, in that thou haste rendred vnto him such slender thankes for them: how little account thou haste made of his

                  <p>Consider also how oftentimes thou haste sworne and forsworne by his holy name in vaine, tearing, and renting it in thy filthie mouth, and vsing it as a testimonie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all thy falshood and lies. Consider likewise how thou haste sanctified the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Feastes which were ordeined to glorifie and praise him, &amp; to bewaile thy sins past: whereas thou hast stood waiting for them to none other end, but only to adde sinne vnto sinne, and so to solemnize feastes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuels.

                  <p>Peruse likewise the workes of mercie, both corporall, and spirituall, and consider how small account thou hast made of thē: and how little regard thou haste had of the necessitie, and miseries of others, being so carefull as thou hast bin to prouide for thy selfe. And now to enter into the benefits &amp; giftes of Almightie God, tell mee I praie thee, how haste thou vsed them? the life which hee hath giuen thee, wherein haste thou bestowed it? thy wit, thy strength, &amp; other giftes of nature, wherein haste thou imploied them? thy goodes, thy landes, and thine other temporal substance, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in haste thou consumed them? For if thou wilt speake plainely the truth, thou must

To bee short, thou haste liued in such sort, as if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest bin bound nothing at all to Almighty God: as if thou haddest neuer receaued of him any benefit at all, or as if thou haddest created thy selfe, and diddest not depend of him.

Whereupon it followeth, that if the person offended be of infinite dignitie, the offence committed against him, must also bee infinitely grieuous, as it is indeede. Wherefore the more a man shal consider, and vnderstand the exceeding greatnesse
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:9371:83"/> of the Maiestie of Almightie GOD, the more shall hee penetrate and vnderstand the malice and heinousnes of his owne sin.

What thing can be more vnseemelie for that soe greate a maiestie, than to preferre so base a thing before him?

For vvhosoeuer doth more esteeme his owne pleasure than God, and doth preferre it before God, he depriueth God thereby (somuch as lieth in him) of that dignitie which is due vnto him as to the last end, and giueth it to his pleasure, which is al one, as to take away the crowne from the Creator, &amp; to giue it to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                     <hi>O</hi> Most mighty Lord &amp; Creator of al things, when I thinke with my selfe how grieuously I haue offended thine infinite Maiestie with my sins, I wonder at mine owne follie: when I consider what a louing and bountifull father I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken: I accurse myne ingratitude: when I behold how I am fallen from such a noble liberty, into such a miserable bondage, I condemne my selfe for an vnconstant foole, &amp; know not what other thing I may set before my eies but only hel &amp; dānation:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:9371:93"/> forsomuch as thy iustice from which I cannot flie, putteth a great terrour into my conscience: But contrariwise when I consider thy great mercie which (as the Prophet witnesseth) exceedeth all thy workes,<note place="margin">Psal. 144.</note> then doe I feele forthwith a fresh and pleasant aire of hope, to refresh and strengthen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine my weake and sorrowfull soule. Wherefore should I than despaire to obtaine pardon of him, who hath so oftentimes by the writings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Prophets inuited sinners to Pennance? saying: <hi>I desire not the death of a sinner,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eze. 18. Eze. 33.</note>
                     <hi>but that he should liue, and be conuerted.</hi> Moreouer thy onely begotten sonne, our sweet Sauiour Iesus Christ, hath reuealed vnto vs by many parables, how readie and willing thou art to graunt pardon to all such as are penitent for their sinnes.<note place="margin">Almightie God is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all such as be penitent &amp; sorie for their sins. Luke. 15.</note> This he signified vnto vs by the iewell lost, and founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: by the strayed sheepe, and brought home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpon the sheepheards shoulders: and much more by the comparison of the prodigall son, whose liuely image I acknowledge in my selfe: For I am hee, that haue most vniustly forsaken thee my most louing father, and haue riotouslie cousumed all my substance, and by obeying the appitites of mine owne flesh haue disobeyed thy commandementes, and by breaking of them haue fallen into the most filthie prison of sinne, and am brought to extreame miserie, out of which I know none other that can help me, but only thou O my almightie God whom I have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:9371:93"/> haue forsaken. Receaue therfore O lord the humble that desireth pardon of thee, whome thou hast so patientlie looked for, euen vntil this present houre. Alas I am not worthie once to lift up myne eies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes thee, or to cal thee father: but for so much as thou art a true father in deed, may it please thee to looke vpon me with thy fatherly eies: for thy only sight raiseth the dead, &amp; it is that which causeth al those that wander out of the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to them selues, for this repentance of sorow for my sins I had not had, if thou hadest not first cast thine eie vpon me. When I went wādring a farre of from thee, thou didest looke downe euen from heauen vpon me, &amp; didest opē mine eies that I might see my selfe, and take a veiw how full fraught I was with so many sinns: and euen at this instant thou commest to receaue me againe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me knowledge, and mindfulnes, of mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, which I haue lost. I doe not request thy most sweet embrasings, and kisses nor the rich gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was wont to cloth me: neither yet the ring of my anciēt dignitie: I seek not to be receiued into the state &amp; dignitie of thy sonnes: but thou shalt doe much for me, in case it may please thee to nūber me among thy bondslaues, &amp; so to marke me with thy signe, and to fetter mee with thy chaines, that I may neuer runne away from thee: againe it shall neuer greeue mee to be in this life one of the most abiect slaues in thy house, so that I
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:9371:94"/> may neuer be separated from thee. Hearken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto me I beseech thee, O most mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; graunt me the fauour of thine only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sonne, and the remedie of his most grieuous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion and death. Graunt me also thy spirit that it may cleanse my heart, &amp; confirme it in thy grace, and fauour, that through myne ignorance, I doe neuer returne againe into my late banishment, frō whence thy mercy hath called me backe. To thee O my Lord be all honour, and glory, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. Amen.</p>

                        </gap>mightie God my Creatour? There are many things of great efficacy, O most om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Lord, to stirre and prouoke the heartes of men to compunction, and to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:9371:94"/> cause them to come to the knowledge of their sins: but there is no one thing so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, as to consider the greatnes of thy goodnes, and the multitude of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which thou haste shewed euen towards sinners themselues: and therefore that my miserable soule may in this wise be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, I will begin O Lord, to rehearse some part of the benefits, and some part of my wickednesse, that hereby it may more clearely appeare, what thou art, and what I am: what thou haste bin towardes me, &amp; what I haue bin towardes thee.</p>
                     <p>A time there was, O Lord, when I had no being at all, and thou gauest me a being, &amp; diddest raise mee vp from the slime of the earth, &amp; diddest make me after thine own image and likenes. Euen from my Mothers wombe thou hast bin my God: for so much as frō the first beginning of my being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this present daie: thou haste bin my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my Sauiour, my defender, and all my comfort: thou hast there formed my body &amp; al my senses: thou hast created my soule with all her powers, and euen vntill this verie instant thou haste preserued my life with the benefits, &amp; cherishings of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidēce: al this was but litle considering thy mighty power: for although the same in it selfe was
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:9371:95"/> was verie much (in respect that it was all:) yet forsomuch as all the same was to thee without any cost or charge, to make mee the more bound vnto thee, thou wouldest bestow vppon mee some thing that should cost thee full dearely, and therefore thou camest downe frō heauen vnto the earth, to seeke mee out, through all those waies whereby I had lost my selfe: Thou haste honoured my nature, with thy humanitie: Thou haste deliuered me out of captiuitie, by thine owne imprisonment: Thou haste plucked me out of the power of the diuel, by putting thy selfe into the hands of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Thou haste destroyed my sins, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon thee the shape and forme of a sinner. It was thy blessed will and pleasure to bind me with this grace, to make mee in loue vvith thee vvith this benefitte, to strengthen my hope with these merits, and to cause me vtterly to abborre sinne, by shewing vnto me what thou haste done to destroy sinne: Thou haste cast hotte bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coales vppon the dead coales of my heart, to the intente that by such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of benefits as are included in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit I should loue thee, that haste done so much for mee, and haste discouered thy so great and speciall loue vnto me.</p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:9371:95"/>
                     <p>Thou seest me here O Lord redeemed: but what should it haue holpen me to bee redeemed, in case I had not beene Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised? Among such a multitude of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels as are dispersed throughout the whole world, it was thy blessed will, that I should be in the number of thy faithfull Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Christians, and one of those to whom belongeth so happie a lot, as to be thy son, regenerated by the water of Holy Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: there was I receaued for one of thine, and there was that wonderfull accord so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized and agreed vpon betweene thee and mee, that thou shouldest be my God, and I thy seruant: thou my father, &amp; I thy sonne: and that so wee should contend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, thou in doing to me the workes of a father, and I in rendring vnto thee the seruices, and obediences of a childe. What shall I say of the other Sacramentes which thou haste ordeyned for a remedie of my miseries, prouiding a medicine for my woundes, with the precious blood of thine owne woundes?</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding now all these kinds of succours and helps, my wickednesse hath bin so great, that I haue lost this first grace of innocencie: and thy mercy hath bin so aboūdant, that thou hast forborne me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:9371:96"/> this present houre. O my hope, &amp; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuge! How can I without teares call to mind, how oftētimes death might haue taken mee out of this world, in all these times so lewdly spent, and yet did not! How many millions of soules are now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps burning in the most horrible tormēts of hell fire, for smaller sinnes than some of those which I then committed, and as yet am I preserued by thee, from burning in that most horrible fire! what should haue come of me, if thou O Lord haddest taken me out of this life at that time, as thou too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest others? What a terrible iudgement should haue bin prepared for mee, in case thy iustice had found me in that damnable state with my grieuous sins so newly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against thee? Who was hee that held hy handes at that time, from doing of iustice vpon me? Who was he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for me when I was fast a sleep? who staide the punishment of thy furie at that time, when I through my sinnes prouoked the same? What sawest thou in me, that it pleased thee to make my state &amp; conditiō better than theirs, whome death tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the middest of their licentious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute wantonnesse, and perillous heates of raging youth? At that time did my sins
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9371:96"/> crie out against me, and yet it pleased thee to stop thine eares, and not to heare them. My wickednesse encreased daylie against thee, and yet did thy mercy encrease day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie towardes mee. I continued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of sinnes against thee, and thou in looking for my repentance: I in running away from thee, and thou in seeking by all meanes to finde mee. I alwaies laboured to offend thee, and thou wast neuer weary of tarrying for my conuersion. And as though my sinnes had bin seruices, and not offences, I did euen in the middest of them receaue from thee manie good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.</note> and manie mercifull rebukes, which did reprehende and condemne my dissolute and sinfull life. How oftentimes haste thou called me, and inwardly cryed vnto mee, saying:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ieremy.</hi> 3.</note> thou haste committed fornication with as manie Louers as thou wouldest, yet returne vnto mee, and I will receaue thee? How many times haste thou called mee with these, and other the like louing speeches: yea, and somtimes feared me also with terrours, &amp; threatninges, by putting mee in minde of the daunger of death, and of the rigour of thy Iustice? How many Catholike preachers &amp; ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers hast thou ordeined, to the end,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:9371:97"/> that with their deuout sermons and godlie counsels, they might awake me, and helpe me out of my wicked damnable estate of life! How oftentimes haste thou pursued mee, not onely with wordes, but also with workes, sometimes alluring me with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and sometimes chastising me with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, laying in waite for me all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies, (as the hunters do when they follow their game) that I should not flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thee.</p>
                     <p>Now what recompence can I make thee O Lord for all these benefits? For in that thou haste created me, I owe vnto thee all that I am: forsomuch as all is thine owne handy worke. In that thou haste preserued me, I owe vnto thee all my being and life: for somuch as thou doest whollie susteine it: and whereas thou gauest thy selfe as a ransome for my redemption, what haue I now remayning to bestow vpon thee? If I had all the liues of men, and of Angels, and should offer them vp all vnto thee in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, what were all this in comparison of one droppe of that most precious blood, which thou haste shed for me?</p>
                     <p>Now who shall giue teares to mine eies,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iere.</hi> 9. <hi>Esay.</hi> 5.</note> that I may bewaile mine vnthankfulnesse for so many benefits? Help mee O Lord at
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:9371:97"/> this present, and giue me grace, that I may know how to confesse mine vniustice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my selfe. I am that vnfortunate mā, which (although it hath not so appeared) am thy creature, &amp; made after thine owne image and likenes. Acknowledge O Lord, this figure which is thine, remooue away that which I haue done, &amp; thou shalt finde that handieworke, which thou haste made with thine owne most mercifull hand. I haue employed all my forces in seeking how to displease thee, and with the verie workes of thine owne hands haue I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee. My feet haue bin swift to al mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and my handes busily exercised in couetousnes. Mine eyes haue bin licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in gasing after vanities, &amp; mine eares alwaies hearkening after lies. That most noble part of my soule which hath eyes to see thee, I haue turned away from behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy glorious beautie, and haue fixed it vpon the fading flowers of this miserable transitory life. That part also, which should haue meditated vppon thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, hath studied both day and night, how to get opportunitie to transgresse thē. Now if my vnderstanding hath bin em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied after this sort, what is to be thought of my will? Thou hast, O my God, offered
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:9371:98"/> vnto my will the delights of heauen, and it hath exchanged heauen for earth. It hath opened the armes (which thou diddest consecrate for thy selfe) to the loue of crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures. This is O Lord the recompence, that I haue made for thy benefits: &amp; these are the fruits, that my senses haue brought forth, which thou haste created. Now what answere shall I make, O Lord, when thou shalt enter into iudgement with mee, and shalt say vnto mee: <hi>I haue planted thee as a vine chosen out of many good plantes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iere.</hi> 2. <hi>Esay.</hi> 5.</note>
                        <hi>and how art thou thus peruerted, and become so wilde?</hi> If thē I know not what to answere to this first demaund, what answere shall I make to the second, as touching the benefit of thy preseruation? Thou hast preserued him, O Lord, with thy prouidence, whose studie was onely bent to none other thing, but wholly to transgresse thy law, to persecute thy seruants, to scandalize the Catholicke Church, and to fortifie the kingdome of sinne against thee: thou haste mooued the tongue that did blaspheme thee: thou hast gouerned the members that haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee: and thou haste giuen sustenance to him that hath serued thine enimies in battaile against thee at thine owne cost &amp; charges: so that I haue not onely bin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:9371:98"/> for thy benefites, but haue also with the verie same benefits made armour to fight against thee: thou haste appointed all creatures to doe me seruice, and I haue bin enamored with all them, &amp; haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery with thē all: forsomuch as for the loue of them I haue so oftentimes offended thee. I haue borne greater affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the gifts, thā to the giuer, &amp; where I should haue taken occasion to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thine excellent beautie, I blinded my selfe with the sight which I beheld, &amp; would not lift vp mine eyes to consider how farre the Creator excelleth in beautie the creature: thou hast giuen me all things to the end that I shuld giue my self whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto thee, &amp; I haue taken the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of them all, and yet I neuer gaue thee either the glory, or the tribute, which of duty I was bound to giue thee. They were alwaies obedient at my Commandement, (because thou haddest giuen them so in charge,) and I alwaies attended to offend thee, for whose sake each thing was ready to doe mee seruice: Thou haste giuen mee health; and the Diuell hath carried awaie the fruite thereof: Thou haste gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee strength, and I haue employed it in the seruice of the DIVELL thine
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9371:99"/> enimie. What shall I say? How is it, that so manie kindes of miseries, and afflictions, which I saw in others, were not sufficient to perswade mee, that all their calamities were thy benefites to mee: forsomuch as thou haddest deliuered me from them all? Art thou onlie he to whom it is lawfull for vs not to be thankefull for a benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued? Who is so priuiledged that hee ought not to shew himselfe thankeful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of whom he hath receaued a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit? If the fiercenes of Lions, and Serpents be tamed with benefits, how is it that thy manifold benefits are not able to make me tame, in such sort that I might some times say with the Prophet:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.24.</note> Let vs feare our Lord, who sendeth vs water downe from heauen in due season, both in the morning and euening, and giueth vs aboundance of al good things euery yere: vndoubtedly O lord, it was a sufficient demonstratiō of thy bountie and excellencie, in that thou hast borne so long with me, being so wicked as I haue beene, &amp; there need no further te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies to declare thy goodnesse.</p>
                     <p>And if the account which thou shalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde of mee for these thinges that cost thee so little shall be so strickt, and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: what account shall that be, vvhich
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:9371:99"/> thou shalt require of mee for those thinges that cost thee thine owne most pretious blood? How haue I peruerted all thy coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels? How haue I defaced (so much as lay in me) al the holy misterie of thy incarnatiō? Thou hast made thy selfe man to make me a God: and I (louing mine owne vilenes) haue made my selfe a beast, and the sonne of Sathan. Thou haste abased thy selfe downe into the earth to exalt mee vp to heauen: and I, vnworthie of such a vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (being not deserued of my part,) would not take notice thereof, nor acknowledge it, but continued still drowned in the filth of mine owne vilenes, and basenes: Thou haste deliuered me out of thraldome, and I returned vnto it againe. Thou haste rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mee from death to life, and I returned to embrace death againe: thou hast incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated mee with thee, and I returned to ioyne my selfe againe with the diuel, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were such excellent benefits of thine able to cause mee to know thee, nor such demōstrations of loue able to allure me to loue thee, nor such merits able to prouoke mee to trust in thee, nor yet such iustice as was executed vppon thee for my sake, to make me afraide of thee. Thou hast hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thy selfe euē to the dust of the earth,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:9371:100"/> and I haue verie fondly aduanced my self aloft, &amp; am puffed vp in mine own pride: thou wast contented to stand naked vpon the Crosse for my sake, and all the vvhole world is not enough to satisfie my coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes. Vnto thee which art the God and Creator of all thinges, were giuen buffets, and blowes, and I which am a sillie worme of the earth doe greatly disdaine, in case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man doe so much as touch mine appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</p>
                     <p>What shal I say, O my Sauiour, but that the mercy and loue that thou hast shewed towasds me, hath bin so great, that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thee to suffer death, therby to destroy sinne in me, and I presuming ouermuch in that thy goodnes and loue, haue taken en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement by the same to sinne against thee. Now what blasphemie can be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than this? I haue taken occasion of thy goodnesse to continue in my wickednesse. I haue bin mooued to sinne by the verie same meane that thou wast mooued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy sinne. After this sort haue I peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thy counsels, &amp; haue made the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy mercy, to serue the wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of my malice. Because thou art so good, I imagined that I might be euill. And because thou diddest bestow vppon

To conclude, thou diddest suffer death as a meane for thee to haue the Soueraignetie ouer the quicke, and the dead: <hi>to the end that</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>those that liue may not liue now to themselues, but to thee,</hi>

                  <p>THESE are, good Christian reader, the praiers, and considerations, that maie help vs to attaine vnto this so great grace of Contrition. And in this part I haue stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the longer, because to haue Contrition for our sinnes is the key and foundation of all the other parts of Pennance,<note place="margin">Contrition for our sins, is the key &amp; foundation of pennance</note> and of all our profit in the spirituall life. Wherefore these praiers ought to be read with as great deuotion, closse recollection of minde, and preparation, as is possible, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with all a fit conuenient time, &amp; a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary place for the same: For oftentimes it chanseth,<note place="margin">Praier ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in our soule.</note> that like as one that beginneth to pray without deuotiō, doth afterwades find it: euen so he that beginneth to read some of these praiers or cosiderations,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:9371:103"/> without Contrition, may in the middest of his prayers obteine it: For as wee reade that our Sauiour was transfigured (as saint <hi>Luke</hi> writeth) whiles he was praying:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.</note> euen so many times whiles we be at our prayers, there are wrought many changes in our soules, and wee obteine that at the end of our praiers,<note place="margin">The end of praier is better than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> which at the beginning we had not: &amp; therefore it is commonly said, that the end of prayer is better than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Now so soone as the Penitent sinner (whether it be by this meane, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) obteineth the spirit of true Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, forthwith at that very instant is the grace of the holy ghost restored vnto him, and the same spirit is giuen vnto him to be his teacher, director, and gouernour of his life: to the end, that it may like a wise and faithfull Pilot, guide him safely vnto the hauen through the raging waues of the tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous sea of this life. At that very time also hee is forthwith vnited by Charitie vnto our Sauiour Christ, as a liuely mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to his head: to the end, that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with him, hee may be made partaker of the influences of his grace, &amp; of the merits and paines of his death, and of his most holy life. Then is hee likewise
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:9371:103"/> receaued and adopted for the son of God, named an inheritour of his kingdome, and treyted as his sonne: For then Almightie God taketh such care and prouidence for him, as he is wont to doe for those whome he so receaueth for his sonnes. Then doth the mercifull Father receaue againe his Prodigall sonne into his house,<note place="margin">

                  <p>At that time doe the heauens reioyce, and the angels sing praises vnto almightie God,<note place="margin">

And all creatures that were sorrowfull before for the offences committed against the Creator, &amp; for the losse of his creature, are then in great ioy, and gladnesse, and doe sing most sweetly Alleluia, for that he is now reconciled and restored againe vnto his grace and fauour. And among them all, the good pastour that had taken such paines in seeking out his straied sheep, &amp; in carrying him home vpon his shoulders to his sheepecote, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteth

                  <p>This is the order that is cōmonly wont to be kept in the conuersiō of fouls: which is euen the same that our Lord obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the sanctification of the worlde, which receaued first the law and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the gospell.

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> But the operation of the Gospell is to comfort and to encourage as it did, when it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon the day of Pentecost vpon the Mount Syon. He then that intendeth to come vnto this Mount, must first passe by the other Mount: that is to say, hee that will receaue the spirit of loue, must first feele the spirit of feare: And he that vvill feele in his soul the operatiō, &amp; consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospell, must first passe by the operation, and feare of the law: And vnto the soule that is thus disposed, there are promised and offered all the graces, and treasures of the Gospell.

Consider now here, by how many kindes of metaphors the workes of the law, and of pennance, are signified on the one side, and the works of the gospell and of grace on the other side, &amp; how the one are promised for the other.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore whosoeuer seeketh to enter into Christes Pallace,<note place="margin">How wee must enter into Christs Pallace.</note> and into the Seller where the pretious wines of the true Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are, he must vnderstād, that the gate whereby we must enter in, is by the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of penance, &amp; by affliction with paines and tribulations. And in case he goe about to enter in by any other way, hee shall be guilty of burglary, &amp; theft. And therefore (my good Christian brother) ascend vpp first with the spouse vnto the hill of mirre, (which is the bitternes of sorrow &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,) and thou shalt heare forthwith those wordes that follow.<note place="margin">

                  <p>True it is, that sometimes it so falleth out that our Lord chaungeth this order, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:9371:107"/> preuenteth them whome hee mindeth to drawe vnto him: first, with blessinges of sweetnes, to the end they should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and shrinke backe with the strokes of mistrustfulnes, and terrour of Pennance, but after that they be once encouraged, and confirmed with those pledges of hys mercy, he then sendeth immediately vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a spirit of great sorrow and feare: after which followeth againe the grace of peace and consolation, whereof wee haue spoken before. This hath our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe signified, speaking with the soule of a true penitent by the Prophet Osee,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Osee.</hi> 2.14.</note> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Behold I will giue her sucke from my breast, and will lead her into the Desert. I will speake vnto her hart, and will giue her the valley of Achor, (vvhich signifieth trouble,) that it may open vnto her the way to hope, and there shall she sing in such sort as she sung in the dayes of her childhood: so that first here is giuen to the soule, the milke of spirituall sweetnes, and afterwards the valley of Achor, which is the trouble and bitternes of Contrition: and this being done, there doe follow out of hand the songs of her childhood, which are the reioycinges, and praysinges of the soule, receauing inwardly the pledges of

                     <p>And here for the satisfying of some Readers, I thinke it cōuenient, to examin a litle, how fōdly or rather maliciously the heretiks of our time do ēde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to auoide this manifest text of our Sauiour
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:9371:112"/> Christs commission graunted vnto his Apostles,<note place="margin">Note the Heretickes new deuised interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission grā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hys Apostles, &amp; their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours: videl. that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinnes, is nothing else but to preach the ghospell.</note> &amp; their successours, to remit sinnes in the sacrament of pennance, by giuing a false glose vnto the text, and interpreting this commission of remitting sins, to be nothing els, but only a commission to preach the Gospell: that so they might bring all remission of sinnes to only faith, and exclude all sacraments, sacrifice, praiers, and other ordinarie meanes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and left by our Sauiour Christ in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church to that end.

                     <p>First therefore, that this commission giuen by our Sauiour Christ here in the twentith chapter of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                        <hi>S.

As in <hi>S. Math.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Euntes ergo docete omnes gentes:</hi> that is. <hi>Going there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teach yee all Nations.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, we must note, that this commissiō gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by our Sauiour vnto his apostles, &amp; their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours in the 20. chap. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> doth not signifie that one speciall kind of preaching Pennance to remission of sins: for he that preacheth penance to a multitude of people, (as <hi>S. Iohn Baptist</hi> did) doth not thereby remit the hearers sins. Neither did our §auiour Christ himselfe remit the Iewes sins by his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:9371:112"/> preaching vnto them, many of them hauing the more sin, in that they heard, and yet obeyed not the gospell: But this remitting of sinnes, whereof our Sauiour Christ speaketh in this 20. cap. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> was such, that thereupon remission in heauen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, or was ioyned. Is it probable that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour would euer haue said to his apostles, Vnto whome soeuer ye preach Penance, or Remission of sinnes, they shall haue Remission of theyr sinnes in heauen? Oftentimes wee see that repentance fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vpon good preaching, and so doth it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also vpon many mens &amp; womens good coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile, and aduise: yet were it a straunge speech to say, that euery man and woman that giueth good aduise vnto another forgiueth his sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this forme of speech here, of remitting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of sinnes, is vsuall in the holy scriptures: and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth not preaching of forgiuenes of sinnes, but actuall forgiuenes of sinnes. As when Christ said to the man sicke of the palsey, and to <hi>Mary Magdalen. Remittuntur tibi peccata tua. Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> And in S. <hi>Mathew</hi> 12. verse 32.<note place="margin">

By all which it appeareth very plainly, that the nevv deuised vvrangling euasion of the Heretickes is foolish and peruerse, in that they vvould vvrest the meaning of our Sauiour Christs commission, graunted to his apostles, and their successours, to forgiue sins, to be nothing els, but only a commission to preach the Gospell vnto sinners: wheras our Sauiour meant therby (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it hath euer bin since, beleeued &amp; practised in all ages in Christs catholike church) that it was a plaine commission giuen by him to his apostles &amp;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:9371:113"/> their successors actually to forgiue sins in the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament of Pennance.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Prophets preached also to sinners to repent theyr sinnes, and to beleeue, that by the Messias they should haue Remission of theyr sins: and yet the auncient Holy Doctors of Christes church beleeued and taught, that Christ gaue to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and to the other Apostles, a farre higher power of forgiuing, and reteyning sinnes than the prophets had. And it is very straunge, that any wise man can be so farre abused by Heretickes, as to thinke, that only to declare to sinners in a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that theyr sinnes be forgiuen them, was that so great and excellent rewarde, which our sauiour Christ promised so solemnely before his Passion to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> for his so notable confessiō of him to be the sonne of God:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19</note> for which our sauiour promised him in recompence, <hi>that he would giue vnto him the keyes of the kingdome of heauen: &amp; that whatsoeuer he should binde in earth should be bound in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> Surely, the auncient Holy Doctors of Christes Church, would neuer haue so highly extolled this <hi>power of the keyes of the kingdome of heauen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19 <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.23</note>
                        <hi>of binding &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in earth, of forgiuing and reteyning sinnes,</hi> which our sauiour gaue to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and to the rest of the Apostles, &amp; their successours, neyther would they haue bin in so great admiration of the great office, and high dignity, that christian Priests haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in case it were no more, hut only to declare to sinners in a sermon, that theyr sinnes be forgiuen them by beleeuing the Gospell.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly: In the wordes of Christ in the twenteth chapter of <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> this is further to he noted, that at what time after his Resurrection, and before his Ascension into heauen he gaue vnto his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles power, and commission to forgiue sinnes in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:9371:113"/> eatth, he breathed vpon his Apostles, &amp; gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the Holy Ghost, by an outward signe. Now I demaund what neede was there to giue the Holy Ghost so extraordinarily at that time to all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles for this only effect, to declare in a sermon to a sinner, that his sinnes be forgiuen him: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Sauiour gaue not then the holy Ghost so fully vnto them for all purposes, as he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at Whitsontide:<note place="margin">Quest. no. &amp; veter. te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamenti. quest. <hi>93.</hi> contra epist. parmeniani. lib. <hi>2.</hi> ca. <hi>11</hi> S.

Wherefore, if any will yet doubt of the Priests power therein, he must needs consequently deny the Holy Ghost to be God, &amp; not to haue power to forgiue sins. <hi>Saint Cirill sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: It is not any absurde thing, or any inconuenience at all, that they forgiue sinnes, who haue the holy Ghost: For when they forgiue or retaine sinnes, the Holy Ghost forgiueth or retaineth sinnes in them, and that they doe two waies: first in Baptisme, &amp; afterwards in Penance: S.

                     <p>I answere, that this generall manner of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, in saying <hi>I am a sinner,</hi> is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to obtaine remissiō of euery particular offence, but that euery penitent sinner ought to specifie in particular wise in his confession vnto his Ghostly Father all his deadly sinnes that hee remembreth.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Ghostly Father knoweth not the secret woundes of our soules, vnlesse wee confesse thē particularly vnto him.</note>For first, the Ghostly Father is appoynted by Christ to be here in earth a spirituall Iudge, surgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and phisition of the woundes of a sinners soule: and I thinke all men will graunt, that it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for one that hath in a battaile receaued ten, or fifteene or eighteene woundes in seuerall parts of hys body, to tell his surgion in a generall sorte, that he is wounded in his body; but hee must shew vnto him all his wounds in particular wise, one by one, in all parts of his body: to the end that the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may duelie consider, and iudge of all the vvoundes particularly, vvhich be more grieuous, and more hard to be cured, and accordinglie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply seuerall plaisters vnto each of the vvoundes: because no good surgion or phisition vseth one plaister for all kindes of woundes, nor one potion,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:9371:115"/> or purgation for all kindes of diseases. And in our case it is to be noted, that sacramentall confession vnto a Priest ought to be vsed as a iudiciall act, to the end that the Priest being iudge vnder Christ of the sinners conscience, may be able to iudge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereof, vvhether to absolue or retaine his sins: and vvhether to apply to him comforts or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges: and how to giue him medicinall penances, and counsaile, according as hee shall iudge by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence had in sacramentall confession vnto him, of the number, difference, heinousnes, and continuance of euery sinners deadly sinnes, and of the seuerall state and order of their liues, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent disposition of theyr consciences.<note place="margin">None can rightly iudge, but by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the particulars.

He <hi>that iudgeth what hee knoweth, is a iudge of iustice:</hi>) Therefore I say, that a generall confession only in saying to a Ghostly Father, <hi>I am a sinner,</hi> vvithout specifying the deadly sinnes in particular, is no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge for the Ghostly Father to iudge rightly of euery sinner, that demaundeth absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, vvhose sinnes are to be remitted, and vvhose sinnes are to be retained.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if such a generall confession by euery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sinner to hys Ghostly Father were sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thereby absolution of him without specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him the particular sinfull actes,<note place="margin">If a generall confession were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, then the Ghostlie Father should be en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forced to ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solue al sins, and retaine none.</note> then this great absurdity vvould follow, that our Sauiour Christ did in vaine &amp; to no purpose giue this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of binding and loosing of sinnes to his apostles, &amp; their successours, because the Priest not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the sinners confession, his particular sinfull

And then euery blasphemer, murderer, adulterer, periurer, theft, vsurer, &amp;c. making one like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of general confession vnto his ghostly Father as others did, would require of his ghostlie father to absolue him also in like sorte as he did others, without doing any maner of penaunce or restitutiō at all for any of his secret and most horribie deadly sinnes of blaspemie, murder, adultry, periurie, thefte, vsury, &amp;c. otherwise hee would accuse his ghostly father of partialitie vsed towardes him: sith his confession was made as all others were, that is in a general sort, with these wordes, <hi>I am a sinner.</hi> And so all Priestes should be inforsed to absolue al sinners of their sins, and to retaine no sinnes: &amp; so their commission and power to retaine sins: should be in vaine, and could not be exercised: which is contrarie to our Sauiour Christes owne commissiō giuen to them in the ghospell of <hi>Saeint Iohn,</hi>

As for example, the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an idle word (which is only a veniall sin) is not so heinous before God, as for a mā to speake blasphemy against the Holie Ghost, or to murther his Father, or to committe incest, or adultery, or to robbe a man of all his goodes which bee most horrible deadlie sinnes. And certaine it is also, that one kinde of deadly sinne is more heynous before God, than an other kinde of deadlie sinne. As murder is more heynous in his kinde than thefte: and incest more heynous than adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: and adultery more heynous than fornicatiō: and heresie, and blasphemie, and to sinne against the Holie Ghost are more heynous before God in their kindes, than all the other kindes of sinnes. And euerie kinde of deadlie sinne requireth a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall discreet consideration &amp; iudgement in the Ghostlie father, what wholesome penances &amp; coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile are most fit &amp; conueniēt for curing of thē. For as one medicine will not serue for al diseases of the body: so likwise one manner of penance &amp; Ghostly
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:9371:117"/> coūsaile wil not conueniently serue for the curing of all kindes of deadly sins, being so different both in malice, scandal, infection, and heinousnes. And withall the seuerall state of life, and disposition of one sinners consciēce, be so diuerse one from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that a more milde medicine wil serue for the curing of one sinner, than will serue for another. Because one sinner conceaueth more inward griefe and remorse of conscience for his sinnes than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And that sinner that hath committed either adultery, robbery, vsury, periury, or fornication, but only once or twice in all his life, is sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, &amp; cured, than another that hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those deadly sinnes very often times, or hath continued in a manner all his vvhole life in them, many yeares together and therefore as the deadly sinnes haue bin committed more often, &amp; in more seuerall kindes, and haue bin more heinous, more scandalous, and of longer continuance in some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinners, than in some others: so the Ghostly Father by hearing euery penitent sinner confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his deadly sinnes particularly vnto him, &amp; by discreet noting of greater compunction &amp; sorrow for the committing of them in some sinners, than in others, may thereby discerne, how to inioyne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sorts of pennances, and how to be more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere, and more milde therein to some penitents, than to others, according as his wisedome and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion shall iudge most fit and conuenient, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery penitent sinner.<note place="margin">

And so would they take away out of the church, aswell all publike confession, as secret confession of secrete deadlie sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Now the catholikes on the other side do first lay their foundation by prouing, that it is as necessary to confesse our secret deadly sinnes to our Ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father to haue absolution of them, as wel as our publike notorious sins.

For we offend Almighty God not only with our publike notorious deadly sins, but euen also with our secret deadlie sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted onlie by consenting thereunto in thought.

                     <p>If then the Ghostlie Father cannot come to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:9371:120"/> knowledge of these secret deadly sins, but by the sinners owne confession: and without his confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, he cannot be duely absolued of them: and without absolution of thē by a christian priest the sinner cannot haue the kingdome of heauen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened againe vnto him, in case by contempt, or wilful negligence he die without absolution: what a madnesse is it then in the Heretickes to denie, that penitent sinners are boūd to confesse to their Ghostly Fathers their secret deadly sinnes, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of them being as necessary for them, as the absolution of theyr publike notorious sins.</p>

                           </gap>han others. The desire to commit a deadly sin is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in Confession.</note> for as the qualities of the persons be diuerse, so be the sinnes also diuerse: as for example, to sinne with a single woman is simple fornication: with a Virgin it is whoredome: with a maried wife, it is adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: with thy neare kinsewoman, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest: with a person that is religious, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated vnto God by vow of chastitie, as Nunnes, &amp;c. it is Sacriledge, or spirituall adulterie. And therefore such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought alwaies to be declared in this sin of the flesh, not only when it is committed in act, but also when it is by only thought, and desire: forsomuch as before almightie God all is one manner of sinne.</p>

He ought also to consider, if whē he committed a deadly sin, it were done in such a place, &amp; before such persons, as that by the euill example which hee gaue, it might be a vehement occasiō vnto others to doe the like. As if a man of authoritie should eate flesh without any necessitie in the holie time of lent, or vpō any other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting daies cōmanded by the church, or els should commit some other offence in the presence of such persons as might thereby
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:9371:137"/> thinke themselues licensed to doe the like. For in this case it shalbe necessary for him to confesse this circumstance of the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, &amp; euil example, which he hath giuen. This point ought verie much to be noted of all Noblemen, and Gentlemen,<note place="margin">A good note for all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, parentes, &amp; maisters.</note> &amp; such as be housholders, &amp; doe keepe seruants, and vse gameing in their houses: likewise of all Fathers, &amp; Mothers, (whose workes and wordes their children doe commonly obserue as lawes:) for the children &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants doe take those things to be lawfull, yea and commendable for them to doe, which they haue seene before practised by their Parents, &amp; Maisters.

But if for vvant of

And albeit this resisting and striuing against the euill thought should continue all a whole daie,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:9371:140"/> so that a man do striue &amp; resist manfullie against it, therein is no sin, but euen a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and merite.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As touching the second maner, that is,<note place="margin">Gening cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell thought is a deadlie sinne.

The manner of confessing this sin is to say: I accuse my selfe, that I haue had a dishonest thought either of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or of hatred, or of lechery, &amp;c. &amp; I haue not put the same euill thought away frō me with such speed as I ought to haue done but haue staied my selfe in it for a time.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 As concerning the third manner, that is, when he giueth his consent vnto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel thought, and determineth to put it in practise, &amp; execution, although afterwards he do it not indeede, it is cleare, that it is a deadly sin, &amp; of the same kinde, as if it had bin perfourmed &amp; executed in act. For (as the learned diuines affirme) <hi>the outward act addeth nothing essentially vnto the inward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. As cōcerning the fourth maner, that is, whē one continueth willingly, or suffereth himselfe to continue in thinking &amp; taking delite in an euil thoght: as how to be reuē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or vpō some other filthie &amp; dshonest
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:9371:141"/> thought, although he intend not to put it in execution, yet it is likewise a deadlie sinne, which by the learned diuines is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (<hi>delectatio morosa, a lingring delight:</hi> which is, as they are wont to say: <hi>Though I drink not in the tauerne, yet I take delight therein.</hi> This is a kind of sinne, wherein for the most parte those are wonte to fal, that are vicious, &amp; dissolute persons and such as take greate pleasure in their own sensual delights. For although this be not a consenting vnto the act of the sinne,<note place="margin">To giue full cōsent vnto the delight of an euil thought is a deadlie sin.</note> yet is it a consenting vnto the delight therof: &amp; a man putteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thereby in manifest daunger to giue his consent vnto the act of the sinne. This is to be vnderstood, when a mā perceiueth his euil thought, and yet doth, not ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor to driue it away from him.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For in case when he perceaueth it, he do forthwith la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to roote out this firebrand from his minde, then shal it be no deadlie sinne: because he cōsidered not what he thought: but yet it is a veniall sin, because he ought to haue bene more carefull &amp; circumspect in taking heed to his thoughts. And this manner of sinne may happen in al kind of deadlie sinnes, though it do chaunce more ordinarilie in sinnes of the flesh, of hatred, &amp; of desire of reuengmēt, which be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:9371:141"/> more fierie, more sticking, &amp; more hardlie to be remoued awaie, than other sinnes be.</p>
                     <p>Into this sinne are al vicious and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest persons wont to fall, who when they knowe no waie how to accomplish their filthy desires, yet do they so much as their power is able to extend: that is, they turne &amp; wallow thēselues in thinking vpon the filthines of the delight, especiallie when either in respect of their credit, &amp; estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by reason of restrainte of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they are past all hope euer to put their filthy desires in execution.</p>
                     <p>Those persons also are in great daunger of falling into this sinne, that are intangled with the dishonest affection of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, by reason of the great force that this affection hath to subdue and conquere the hart, and to bring it in subiection to the thing which it loueth. And therfore their is nothing more daungerous than to suffer such an affectiō to haue any entrie into our minds: because it is as much as to entertain in our house a most cruell tyrant, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroier of innocencie, and a stirrer &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoker of infinite sins.</p>
                     <p>Such <hi>woers</hi> also are in verie great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into this sin,<note place="margin">A note for woers.</note> as be too vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:9371:142"/> and feruent in their wooing, &amp; dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Mariage: for although the delits of them that are maried be lawfull after that they are maried, yet are they not so before mariage. Because the delight is present, &amp; the mariage is to come, the which may ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie waies be letted, &amp; therefore such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is not lawful as is taken at that time: I meane before the mariage.</p>
                     <p>Now that we haue vnderstood theise foure differences of thoughts, it shalbe an easie matter to know how to confesse thē: by declaring, whether the penitent staied himselfe in the euil thought, or consented therunto, or whether he had any lingring delight therein, by continuing willinglie in taking delighte in the same euill thought.</p>

                  <p>The second is, if in hys Confession hee did willingly conceale and hide from hys Ghostly Father any deadly sinne: as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, adultery, theft, fornication, periurie, or any other deadly sinne.

And albeit that the ignorance were such that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:9371:144"/> not withstanding it sufficeth to excuse him from this new bond.</p>
                  <p>The third case is, if hauing bin a long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> time from Confession he hath not exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his conscience before hee commeth thereunto: for in this case forgetfulnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth not the penitent, but doth rather accuse him the more, as wee haue before declared.</p>
                  <p>The fourth case is, when the penitent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> mindeth not to leaue or forsake the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sin wherein he hath offended: as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake Heresie, Schisme, adultery, fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theft, vsury, enmity, reuenge, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deadly sin wherein he liueth: or whē hee intendeth not to make restitution of such goods or lands, as he ought to restore.</p>
                  <p>The fift case is, when the penitent is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and procureth not to be. first absolued from the Excōmunication</p>
                  <p>The sixt case is, when the Ghostlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> being ignorant, and the penitent him selfe also is not learned, there are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing great and weighty matters to be discussed in his confession: for in this case it can not be, but that some errours vvill happen that haue need of a further cure, as we haue before declared.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be noted, that in euery one
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:9371:145"/> of these cases wherin it is necessarie to ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Confession, if it be done with the selfesame Ghostly Father it is not neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to repeate all those sins afresh, which he Confessed at such a time, in case the Ghostly father be mindefull of them: but it shalbe sufficient to say, I accuse my selfe of all those sins, which at such a time I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed vnto you my Ghostly Father: and besides those sinnes, I accuse my selfe of such &amp; such a deadly sin, for vvhich I am now bound to iterate this Confession.</p>
                  <p>And because many for good cause may feare, least they haue had peraduenture some of these foresaid defects in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Confessions,<note place="margin">Note this counsaile.</note> therefore it seemeth to me very good counsaile, that euerie one doe once in his life make a Generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in a very exact and diligent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that therewith he may reforme, and put away all these defectes, and negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and haue from that time forwardes greater diligence, and care of himselfe, than he had before.</p>

                        <hi>Note that it is a deadly sinne likewise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with any witches: to exercise their witchcraft, about any thing. And note also, that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to seke to vndoe, or dissolue one witch-craft with an other witchcraft, albeit the witch of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doe offer to dissolue or vndoe it. Because witchcraft is in his owne nature, euill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be admited, though it would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue the former witchcraft. Forsomuch as euill thinges ought not to be done, to the end that anie good thing should come thereof. And the Diuelles doe neuer kepe promise with any man, or woman, but to their distruction. And note, that <hi>Franciscus Pegna</hi> in his learned commentaries vpon the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Heresie made by <hi>Ambrosius de Vignate,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that it was condemned as an errour by all the learned diuines of Paris, <hi>An.

And so it is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all learned Diuines. Howbeit it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to dissolue witch-craft by lawfull meanes. And the best remedie is by true penance: by deuout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the most blessed Sacrament by earnest prayers both by him-self, and by other godlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout persons: by Almes-deeds, and fasting: by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-water and by the allowed Exorcismes of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church.</hi>

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:9371:177"/> sinne. By <hi>Charity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whatsoeuer is contrarie to Charitie is a deadlie sinne.</note> wee vnderstand the loue of God, and of our neighbour: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to this Rule, whatsoeuer is against the honour of God, or the profit of our neighbour in any matter of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is a deadly sinne.</p>
                  <p>As to do or speak any thing that may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit his good name, or fame, or to hurt him in his goods or landes, or such like: for this quencheth <hi>Charity,</hi> wherein consisteth the spirituall life of the soule. And therfore it is rightly and aptly called a deadly sin, because it taketh away the spirituall life: but whatsoeuer is not against Charity, but only besides Charitie, is a veniall sinne:<note place="margin">What a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall sin is.</note> as idle wordes, which hurt no man: or some kind of little vaine glory, of anger, of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or of glottony, I meane, to eate a little more than is necessarie, or such like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Second Rule.</note>The second rule is more speciall: which is, that whatsoeuer is contrarie to any one of the Commaundementes of Almightie God, or of the Catholicke Church, is a deadly sinne. As that which is done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Commandement, that saieth: <hi>Thou shalt not steale:</hi>

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:9371:177"/> pay tithes: to confesse our sins to our own Pastor, or to some other, with his licence, at the least once euery yeare, to receaue the most blessed Sacrament at Easter: to Fast in Lent, and vpon other dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Fasting.<note place="margin">Summa.

Numer. 3.</note> But it is diligently to be noted, that that which is of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a deadly sin, may be a veniall sin, by one of these two waies: to wit, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the matter is but small, and of little importāce, (as if one should steale a clust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of grapes, or a pin, or a point, or such a like triffle:) or because the worke is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, by reason that it wanted a full cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and deliberation: as it may happen in euill thoughts, without any consent giuen thereunto, but yet euil resisted: for which cause, that which of it selfe was a deadly sin, is by the imperfection of the work, no more than a veniall sin. Likewise here it ought to be cōsidered, that there be three kinds of cōmandements:<note place="margin">Of three kinds of cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandemēts.</note> wherof some are negatiue: as, <hi>Thou shalt not kill, &amp;c.</hi> which do bind vs euer, &amp; for euer: that is in euerie time, &amp; at al times: others be affirmatiue, as to giue alms: to haue contritiō for our sins: to loue almighty God,<note place="margin">Summa.

For this commaundeth to restore, and commaundeth also not to withhold our neighbours goods, and these &amp; such like Commandements doe bind vs to obserue them both manner of waies, to wit: euer, and at all times. And therefore it is not sufficient for him that is in debt, &amp; ought to restore, to haue an intent &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed minde to make restitution in time to come: but it is necessary that he doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store forth with: because he ought not to retaine the goods, or landes, which doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto another, against the will of the owner: the which is a Commaundement negatiue, which bindeth vs euer, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that is, at all times: wherefore, he that retaineth after this sort the goods or lands of others, let him well consider his owne case, and let him make restitution out of hand, and without all delay, as wee haue declared.</p>

                     <note place="margin">

                        </gap>th his sinnes? deliuer me O Lord, from my secret offences.</hi> An other cause is, because the sinnes of iust persons (of vvhome the wise man saieth, that they fall seuen times in the day,) are rather sinnes of omitting, than of committing. The which kinde of sinnes are very hard to be knowen.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:9371:179"/>
                  <p>But for the better vnderstanding of this matter, it is to be noted, that all sinnes are committed by one of these two waies: to wit, either by way of Committing: tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is, by doing any wicked deed: as by robbing, killing, committing fornication, &amp;c. Or by way of Omitting: (that is, by leauing some good thing vndone: as for not louing god, not fasting, not praying, not hearing of Masse, &amp;c.) Now, of these two kindes of sinnes, the first, (because they consiste in doing) are very sensible, and easie to be knowen: but the second kinde of sinnes, (consisting not in dooing, but in omitting or leauing vndone,) are much harder to be knowen: because that thing vvhich is not, hath no meane to shew it selfe, for to come to light. Wherefore, it is not to be maruelled at, that spirituall and deuout persons (especially if they be simple,) doe not finde some-times in examining theyr consciences any sinnes, whereof they may accuse them-selues in theyr Confession. For these persons not falling so often into those sinnes of committing,) whereof we haue spoken,) and the other sinnes which be of Omitting, being not easie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, hereof it commeth, that they know not wherof to make their confessiō,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:9371:180"/> &amp; therefore are they so grieuously vexed.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, for remedy hereof I thought good to ordeine this Memoriall, for the instruction of such persons: wherein is chieflly treated of those kinde of sinnes, which are of <hi>Omitting.</hi> And because these sinnes may be, eyther against God, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our selues, or els against our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I haue therefore deuided the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall into three parts, which doe treate of these three kindes of negligences. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which negligences, there be manie which sometimes are not so much as veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sinnes: but yet they are imperfections, and defects, and oftentimes they may be veniall sins. And therefore such as walke towardes perfection, should not whollie pretermit in their Confessions, to accuse themselues of them. Howbeit, this is not conuenient to be done at all times, but at certaine times, (and especially vpon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Feastes,) for otherwise wee should weary our Ghostly Father ouermuch with the superfluous length of our Confessions: but at other ordinary times, whē we come to Confession, euery man may take hys choyce out of these negligences, as he shal think may best serue for the dischargeing of his conscience in that behalfe.</p>

                  <p>INTENDING to make an introduction for the better vnderstanding of the Churches doctrine concerning the satisfaction of penitent sinners, I thinke it very conuenient, to giue warning to the christian reader, to take diligent heede of the heretikes common slaunderous and crafty dealing in treating thereof: whereby they haue circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented great numbers of the vnlearned people, &amp; alienated their mindes from the Catholicke Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giō, to giue credit vnto their new heretical doctrin.</p>
                  <p>For first in treating in their bookes &amp; sermons of our workes of satisfaction, they make no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction or difference at all,<note place="margin">The deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing of heretikes, in treating of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> in what state the works of satisfactiō are done: whether in the state of deadly sin, or in the state of grace, neyther yet doe they distinguish betweene satisfaction for the fault of sin, &amp; satisfaction for the paine of sin: nor whether the workes of satisfaction are to be done for satisfaction of the euerlasting paine, or for
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:9371:185"/> satisfaction of the temporall paine.<note place="margin">Note the Churches doctrine cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Satisfaction.</note> Whereas the Churches doctrine is, that none of our workes be satisfactory vnto God for any of our deadly sins, vnlesse they be first abolished by the grace of god: because no workes done in the state of deadly sin, (being then done by an enimie of God) can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God. For vnlesse the person be first reconciled and gratefull vnto God, his workes of satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can not be gratefull and acceptable vnto him: but when the workes of satisfaction be done by a penitent sinner in the state of grace, then it is to be presupposed, that the fault of the deadly sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him after Baptisme, and the euerlasting pain due vnto it, be already abolished by the grace of God, by vertue of our Sauiour Christs satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion communicated vnto him. And then his good Christian vertuous workes of Fasting, Praier, and almes-deedes; &amp;c. being done by him in the state of grace, (as a member of Christ, &amp; an adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue sonne of God,) are vnited vnto Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and be then very gratefull and acceptable vnto God, and doe satisfie his diuine iustice for the temporall paine remayning for a penitent sinner to suffer, when his sorrow and contrition for hys sinnes is not so feruent, and perfect, as by order of the Diuine IVSTICE is prescribed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>And note well, what I affirme, that these paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertuous workes of satisfaction done by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner be satisfactory vnto the diuine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,<note place="margin">Our workes of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be onely for the guilt of temporall paine, &amp; not for the guilt of euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paine in Hell.</note> only for the guilt of temporall paine, &amp; not for the guilt of euerlasting paine in Hell, (as the Heretikes doe falsly slaunder the doctrine of the Catholicke Church,) Because the guilt of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting paine euer accompanieth the deadly sin, (as the shadow doth the body,) and is euer pardoned

                  <p>Hereunto we make foure answeres. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answere. </seg>
                     </label> First, that this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> promise is made by almighty God vpō this <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to wit: <hi>If the sinner shall doe penance for his sin:</hi> but perfect pennance comprehendeth in it satisfaction vnto God for the sin, therefore the sinner doth not perfect pennance, that satisfieth not for the guilt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> temporall paine due vnto his sin. Secondly we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech</hi> 18.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.</note> that a <hi>condition</hi> is also limited here to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in these words. <hi>Si impius custodierit omnia prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta mea, &amp; fecerit iudicium, &amp; iustitiam:</hi> that is to say: <hi>If the sinner keepe all my commaundements, &amp; doe iudgement, and iustice:</hi> which doing of iudgement, &amp; iustice, is performed by doing of painfull works <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of satisfaction. Thirdly we answere, that albeit we admit, that no mention is made here of any satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for sin, yet it followeth not therefore, that no satisfaction ought to be made vnto God for sin· for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> maketh no expres mention here of <hi>Faith,</hi> or of <hi>Hope,</hi> or of <hi>Charitie:</hi> neither yet of many other vertues, which be all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> necessary for the obteyning of life euerlasting. Fourthly we answere, that in that he saieth, he will not remēber the iniquities of the wicked, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that he wil no more account the penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:9371:190"/> for his enimie. But this promise hindreth not, but that he may punish a penitent sinner after his reconciliation into his frendshippe, though not in seuere maner, with euerlasting damnation, as hee punisheth his enimie, yet in a Fatherly louing maner, with temporal correction, as a Father cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiseth his child for his fault. According as <hi>Saint Paule</hi> very plainlie affirmeth, saying.<note place="margin">

                  <p>And according to this exposition, are all other authorities in the holie Scriptures to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where it is affirmed, that <hi>God casteth our sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back: and into the bottome of the Sea,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Note here the reasons, Why paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vertuous workes of Satisfaction, be necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing Christs suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note>And surely, for very good reason, and for the eschewing of great inconueniences, our painefull vertuous workes of satisfaction be necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of vs, by almighty God, notwithstanding our Sauiour Christs sufficient satisfaction: because otherwise most christians would be very carelesse and negligent in doing of good workes, &amp; would conceaue a security and most certaine assurance of theyr saluation, through the sufficiency of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christs satisfaction, and so they would vse, (as very many doe in their corrupt time of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) our sauiour Christs redemption, and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a cloke, to couer their carelesse slouthfull &amp; dissolute wicked liues, and account all good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous painefull workes of prayer, fasting, almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes, &amp; all other painefull doing of pennance, and austere vsage and mortification of theyr flesh, to be superfluous, and in vaine.</p>
                  <p>But the most principall &amp; singular reason, why some satisfaction is required of penitent sinners by vertuous painefull workes, (as by fruites wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of pennance) is because our sauiour Christes will is, that the merite of his Passion shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and applied vnto christians, so far forth,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:9371:201"/> as the order of the diuine iustice requireth. And therefore, forsomuch as our sauiour Christ, hath suffered innocently for our offences, his holy will and ordinance is, (according as reason and the due order of iustice requireth,) that wee that haue bin the offenders, and the cause of his most grieuous &amp; bitter Passion, should resemble, and be like in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vnto him, who is our head, our maister, our patterne, and exampler.

                  <p>And our Sauiour Christ himselfe hath reuealed vnto vs in his holy scriptures, that if we will be his members, and conforme our selues vnto him, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our head, we must then imitate him in our liues, and beare our Crosse euery day, and suffer vvith him.

After this sort doth the Sacrament of Pennance sometimes heale perfectly, and deliuer a sinner both from sinne, and paine, when there concurreth with all a verie perfect Contrition, (such as that Contritiō of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalene</hi> was,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Of this we may take an example euen in worldly affaires: For if a Gentleman do commit an offence against his Prince, for the which he deserueth to suffer the paines of death: yet may he afterwardes doe him such, &amp; so great seruices, as he may deserue his Princes grace, &amp; fauour, and receiue a generall pardon, and cleare discharge from all this punishment.

                     <hi>When I (saith he) came first into this</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie, <hi>I beheld therin certaine things, which neither the eies of the sluggard haue euer seene, neither the eares of the negligent hard, nor yet may it be cōceiued within the hart of the rechles &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Christians. I heard and saw words and deeds of such force, that they might haue enforced (if I may vse such kinde of speach,) euen Almightie God himselfe, and incline him vnto mercy. I sawe many of those</hi> Holie penitents, <hi>which stood the whole night abrode in the aier, watching, and neuer so much as once mouing out of one place. And when sleepe seemed to ouercome them, they stroue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiled them selues with verie iniurious wordes: &amp; so by force they repelled the sleepe away frō their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:9371:214"/> vnto Almightie God, with teares, and sighes for pardon and mercie. Others contrariewise saied with the Publican, that they were not worthie to lift vp their eyes towards Heauen,</hi>

                     <hi>neyther yet to speake vnto Almighty God. And after this sort they held their faces downe to the ground, offering their soules in silence vnto the mercy of God, with out speaking any one word at all, as men that had bin dumbe, full of feare and confusion. There were others cloathed in sacke, and haire-cloath, which were kneeling with their faces bowed downe to their knees, striking their foreheads oftē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the earth, with great sorrow, &amp; bitternes of minde. Among these there were some, that had before them the very earth all wette, and bathed with teares. Others there were, which (because they wanted those teares) lamented verie grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously. Many of them did (as the custome is ouer the graues of the dead) bewaile their owne soules, weeping &amp; lamenting the fall and death of them. Others after the manner of Lyons roared &amp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the bottome of their heartes, yet repressing within them their sorrow and griefe: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (when they were not able to refraine anie more) they burst out sodainely into grieuous cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and dolorous lamentations. I saw certaine of them, who in their iudgements, deedes, and thoughts, were so far distracted from themselues, as if they had bin Images of stone: For by reason
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:9371:215"/> of their great pensiuenes, they were become in a mā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner vnsensible of anie thing. And these had their soules, as it were drowned in the bottome of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: &amp; with the continuall fire of their heauines, had alreadie dried vpp the fountaines of their teares.</hi>

                     <hi>And alitle after in the saide Historie, this holy Father goeth forward, and saith in this wise: There mightest thou haue seen those</hi> Holie penitents, <hi>going in a malancholie maner, &amp; loking downe to the earth: who hauīg already cōtemned the thoughts of their flesh, mingled the bread which they did eat with ashes &amp; their drinke with teares.

Manie of them had their tonges hanging out of their mouthes, like vnto wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried dogges, that were tired with ouermuch run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; halfe dead, &amp; dried vp with extreme thirst Others stood parching themselues at the Sun in the middest of sommer.

Some of thē tooke a litle water to refresh their tongue, not drink<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing thereof so much as was necessarie. And others likewise did eate a little bread, and the rest they
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:9371:215"/> cast from them, saying: that they were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eate the meate of men, sith they had done the deedes of beastes.</hi>

Where were the delicate dishes and deuises of gluttonie? All their studie and care was to cry vnto our Lord both day, and night, and the sound of prayer and Meditation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was heard amongst them.

                     <hi>Besides all this, what a meruailous thing was it: to behold the forme and euill treating of their owne bodies?

Their knees were hardened like vnto Cammels knees, by continuall vse of payer. And their breasts were so galled with continuall knocking, that many of them auoided spittle mingled with blood. These blessed Penitents made their Petition vnto the Father of the Monasterie, (who was indeed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Angell among men,) that he would fetter both theyr neckes, and handes in chaines, and shackle theyr feet with irons, and neuer to deliuer them from thence, vntill such time as they might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnto their graues: of the which buriall also, they accounted themselues vnworthy.</hi>

                     <hi>But besides all this, what shall I say of theyr house, and lodging, in which they dwelled? For it was so foule and obscure, and so horrible &amp; stinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall, that certainely it was (as they tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it,) a very prison indeed: and such a one, as the only sight and forme thereof, was able of it selfe to baue taught a man pennance.</hi>

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:9371:218"/> the fire of Charitie, from whence the sweet teares doe proceed, when he calleth all this to minde, he is then striken and pearced vnto the very heart, with such a sharpe sorrow, and extreame pensiuenes, that he would be content, not only to abide with great patience all these trauailes &amp; paines, but he would also euen rent and teare himselfe in peeces, yea, and crucifie himselfe, if he might lawfully doe it.</hi>

                     <hi>In this wise then, these Holy Fathers remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring themselues of their former happie state, in which they liued, and calling to minde those so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sweet spirituall exercises, wherewith they were brought vp,</hi>

When his light shined vpon my head, when I wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with his light in the darke places, when hee washed my feet with milke, and ministred vnto me out of the rocke streames of Oyle?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After this sort each one of them calling to minde particularly all theyr wonted spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, and the great fauours, and consolations, which they had receaued of Almighty God, they wept full bitterly, and sayed among themselues: where is that wonted purity of our praier now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? Where is that so great confidence, with which wee were accustomed to pray? Where are
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:9371:218"/> those sweet teares, which were wont to trickle down in the middest of our afflictions, &amp; griefes? Where is the glory of that most pure chastitie? Where is that faithfull loyalty, and obedience towardes our Prelate? Where is that vertue &amp; efficacie of our praiers? All these thinges are perished, gone, and vanished away like vnto smoke. And whilest they spake these wordes, the sorowe which they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for their losse was so great, and they abhorred themselues so much, that they made their requests vnto Almightie God, that he would send them all kinds of torments in this life, and take reuenge of their bodies, sith they were the occasion of their so great woe, and miserie. Some of them desired, that it might please Almighty God, to send them here in this life fome grieuous disease. Others praied that they might loose their eyes, and sight, and so be made a spectacle of misery to the whole world: Some of them requested, that they might be benū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and lamed both of hand and foot, that these present miseries and paines might be a meane for them to escape the miseries and paines which are to come: But I, my brethren, knew not in the world how I could continue so long time among such store of teares. For I continued with them only thirtie dayes, after which time, I returned vnto the Holy Father that gouerned in the Monasterie, and hee perceauing me so much amazed, &amp; altered, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood strait way the cause of my disquietnes, and
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:9371:219"/> said vnto mee. What is the matter, Father Iohn? Haste thou seene the battailes of those men, that fight so valiantly? Yea Father, (quoth I) I haue seene them indeed: I haue seene them, &amp; do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonder at the sight. And truely I account those far more happie, who after their fall, doe thus sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully bewaile their sinnes, than others that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fell, and therefore neuer bewailed, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as these Penitents haue done. For it seemeth vnto mee, that the falles of these and such others (the graee of God so disposing, and working it,) haue bin occasion of this theyr wonderfull rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and exaltation.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>All these in a maner are the wordes of saint Iohn Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macus, who beareth witnes of all these thinges, yea, &amp; of many others also, more wonderfull, &amp; terrible, the which (as he saith,) he saw with his owne eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This auncient History, I thought good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to rehearse in this place for many purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. First, that wee might be ashamed, and humble our selues, when we see the cold &amp; slacke pennances of our corrupt age, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the same with the feruour, &amp; rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous discipline of those auncient Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that we might see, how far the vertue of Charitie, and the light of the holy Ghost extendeth it selfe, the which is alwaies ready for all the faithfull, as well for them that liued in times past, as also for those, that be aliue at this present, or shalbe
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:9371:219"/> hereafter, if they endeuour to trauaile and labour in doing of Pennance, as these holy penitents haue done. Thirdly, that by this hope, and example, wee might awake our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> selues out of our drowsie &amp; heauie sleepe, and be mooued to take somewhat more paines in doing Pennance for our sinnes, than wee vse to doe: considering what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great labour and paines these holy Saintes haue taken, who had none other bodies, than such as we haue, neither yet any other Lord or helper to strēgthen thē therein: for the examples of great acts are declared vnto vs to this end, that wee should not be discouraged to set vpō the lesser. True it is, that no man ought to be dismaid, if he do not so much, as these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Fathers haue done.

                  <p>Moreouer, as in a man there are three principal things with which we doe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offend Almightie God, to wit, our

                  <p>VVHEREFORE he that desireth earnestly, and withall his hart, to make satisfactiō vnto Almighty God, must principally exercise himselfe in these three vertues. And first, let him begin with <hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the which (as we haue saied) with the griefe of the paine maketh recompence for the delight of sin, and chastiseth the flesh: which for the greater part was the cause of
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:9371:221"/> al our sinnes. Moreouer, (Saint <hi>Barnad</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Barnard.</note> sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) whilest we by fasting do absteine from things, which be lawfull, we obteine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pardon and forgiuenes of things vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And (as the same Holie Father saieth) Fasting is not onlie a washing a way of our ordinarie sinnes, but also ameane for the extirpation of vices: And it doth not onlie dispose the soule to be apt to obteine pardō of the faulte,<note place="margin">The fruites of Fasting.</note> but also increase of grace: and not only to cancel the sins past, which we haue cōmitted, but to preserue vs also euen from those which we might commit in time to come. For Fasting (as <hi>Petrus de Rauenna</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Petrus de Rauenna.</note> saith) is a fortresse of God, a castle of Christ abulwarke of the Holie Ghost, a banner of faith, ensigne of Chastitie, &amp; a standard of holines. Fasting (saieth S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</note>) purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the soule, lifteh vp the vnderstanding, subdueth the flesh vnto the spirit, frameth the harte to be contrite, &amp; humble, caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cloudes of concupiscence to vanish awaie, quencheth the heats of leacherie, &amp; kindleth the light of chastitie. Fasting is a bridling of our appetites, a mortification of our passions, a discipline of our life, and a temperature of couetousnes. Fasting is the brother of pouertie, the sonne of penance, the Mother of chastitie, the companion
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:9371:221"/> of praier, the destroier of selfe-loue, the keeper of health, and a most effectuall meane to pacifie the anger of ALMIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE GOD, and to obteine his grace and fauour.<note place="margin">

By Fasting the people of Israell became humble, and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies succoured in their necessities. By Fasting those three young men were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the furie of the King of BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BILON. By Fasting <hi>Elias</hi> was taken vp in the fierie Chariot. With fasting <hi>Moyses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the lawe frō God. And with fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of God prepared himselfe for preaching of the Gospell: not that he had anie need so to doe, but for our example.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, he that desireth earnestly to make Satisfaction vnto Almighty God, to be reuenged of his enimies, the flesh, the world, and the diuell, and to enioy all these priuiledges, he must arme himselfe with a couragious and Holie hatred against himselfe, (I meane against his owne flesh,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. <hi>vers.</hi> 21.27 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 31.</note>) doing iustice vpon the same, &amp; chastising it with often fasting, watching, discipline hairecloth, rough aparrel, hard bedding, &amp; with the greatest austerity of life that he may. For by these meanes he shall not only make Satisfaction to Almightie God, but
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:9371:222"/> he shall also triumph ouer the mightiest of all his enimies, and shall make his bodie, &amp; foule,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</note> a most liuely tēple of the holy ghost.</p>
                  <p>But al this ought to be done, with great discretion, and moderation. For we ought in such sort to chastice our enimie, that we kil not the man, and destroy not the bodie, of which we stand in need, for the seruice of Almightie God.

                  <p>BVT to the end that this Fasting may be the more profitable vnto vs, it is
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:9371:222"/> necessary to accompany the same with the works of mercy. For (as <hi>S. Augustine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</note> saieth,) fasting without charity, and almesdeedes, may be likened vnto a lamp without oyle. And the same holie Father saieth in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place: O my brethrē, giue almes, that your praiers may be heard, &amp; that Christ may helpe you to amend your liues, and graunt you forgiuenes of your sinnes past, &amp; deliuer you from al such miseries, as are to come, &amp; giue you eternal felicity. And to this end saieth likewise <hi>Petrus de Rauenna</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Petrus de Rauenna.</note> that although fasting doe take way the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of vices, the passions of the flesh, and the occasions of sinnes yet doth it not giue perfect health, without the ointmēt of mercie, the flood of pittie, and the help of Almesedeeds. Fasting (saith he) healeth the woundes of sinnes:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tob.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.41. <hi>Eccles</hi> 4.33.</note> but it taketh not awaie the scarres of them, without the baulme of Mercie. <hi>Almesdeeds</hi> (saith Holie <hi>Tobias) deliuereth from sinne, and from death, &amp; suffereth not the soule to goe into darknes. And Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, that <hi>like as water quencheth fire: euē so doe almesdeeds quench sins.</hi> Vpon such wordes <hi>S. Ambrose</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</note> writeth thus: Great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is the force of Almesdeeds, sith that with the foūtaine of her beneuolēce it quencheth the flames of sins, &amp; with the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:9371:223"/> flood of her bountifulnes it extinguisheth the heat of vices: &amp; that in such sort, that although almighty God be offended, and prouoked to wrath: yet through vertue of Almesdeedes he pardoneth him, whome he determined before to haue punished for his sinnes. And <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> saieth, that like as the fire of Hell is quenched with the washing of the wholesome water of Baptisme: euen so is the flame of sinnes quenched with Almesdeedes, and workes of iustice. So that the forgiuenes of sinnes, which is giuen once in Baptisme, is daily imparted vnto vs, through the exercises of Almesdeedes, as it were, by an other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond baptisme. True it is that the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison is not alike in al partes: neuerthelesse it maketh very much for the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glorie of almesdeedes, to be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto this heauenly washing, which is the fountaine and gate of life. Wherefore, the <hi>Prophet Daniell</hi> found none other meane to deliuer the king <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> from that so terrible sentence, which was thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered against him from heauen, but only to giue him counsaile, that he should leane vnto this holie anchor of almesdeedes: say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him. <hi>Take, O King, my counsaile, &amp; redeeme thy sins with almesdeedes, &amp; thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties

                  <p>But it is very much to be noted, what <hi>S. Augustine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. August.</note> writeth touching this matter, saying:<note place="margin">There is no worke of mercy grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than to pardō them that haue offended vs.</note> that although there be many kinds of mercies, by which we may obteine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of our sins: yet there is none grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than to forgiue him from the bottome of our heart, that hath committed an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against vs. In like manner saieth a certaine Holy Father: O man (saith hee) consider that thou canst not be without sinne. And wouldest thou haue thy sinnes alwaies forgiuen thee? Well then, forgiue others alwaies, as thou wouldest that thine owne sinnes should be forgiuen thee. And if thou wilt so doe: I giue thee thus much to vnderstand, that in forgiuing, &amp; pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others, thou giuest pardō to thy selfe. The very same doth another Holy Father also say in these wordes. Hee that hath not to redeeme such as be in Captiuitie, nor to cloath the naked, let him endeuour, that he keepe no hatred in his heart against his neighbours: and let him take heed, that he doe not one shrewd turne for another vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his enimies: but rather let him loue thē, and pray for them and put his confidence in the mercie &amp; promises of our Lord, and him
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:9371:224"/> say thus vnto him. Giue mee O Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue giuen: and forgiue mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue forgiuen.</p>

Take away from vs, O Lord, all iniquities, and receaue our good hearts, &amp; we will offer vnto thee the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our lips. With such kind of wordes
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:9371:225"/> treat without our Lord in praier, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie that diuine heart, which is far harder, than any Adamant towardes the proude, and much softer than the molten wax to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the penitent and humble.

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:9371:225"/> thou shalt likewise be a louer of mercy: for praier will so work, that thou shalt be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully heard of Almighty God, because thou haste also heard thy neighbour, for the loue of him: but fasting helpeth praier,<note place="margin">Fasting help<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth praier.</note> by disposing a man thereunto: for in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening the bodie frō the heauie waight of meates, it causeth it to be the lighter to flie a loft. Wherfore the praier of him that fasteth, (besides that it is more Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) is also more Spirituall and more pure. For which cause the same Holie Father saieth: that the soule of him, that fasteth, praieth with sobriety, and attention: but the soule of the glutton, &amp; disordered eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is full of fantasies, and filthie thoughts.</p>
                  <p>And like as fasting helpeth praier, euen so praier helpeth Fasting. For (as <hi>Saint Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Saint Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</note> saieth) praier obteineth vertue, and strength, to be able to fast: and fasting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth grace to praie. So that the strength and power, which a man hath need of to chastice his flesh, is giuen him by the tast and spirit of praier: forsomuch as euery one of these vertues taketh vpon it that part, which apperteineth vnto it, in the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of man. For (as <hi>Saint Ierome</hi>

                  <p>And
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:9371:226"/>Wee finde then (according as it hath beene declared) that praier besides that it is a <hi>worke Satisfactorie,</hi> (which is the thing that belongeth vnto this present treatise,) is also a <hi>worke Meritorious, Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> and a <hi>causer of deuotion.</hi> As concerning that part, that it is <hi>Satisfactory,</hi> we discharge thereby the debts of our sinnes. In that it is <hi>Meritorious,</hi> we deserue thereby increase of grace, &amp; glory. In that it is <hi>Impetratiue,</hi> we obtaine by the same, the thing which we humbly desire. And in that it is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and causer of deuotion, we get there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a new light, a taste of God, a renewing of good purposes, and desires, a peace and quietnesse in our soules, and a strength and promptnes to doe good workes, which is the thing, that is properlie called deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">The fruite of praier.</note> These foure so principall fruites doth the vertue of praier bring with it.

                  <p>But because wee shall treate of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of praier hereafter more at large, I will say no more at this present, but referre the Christian Reader vnto the praiers &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, which we haue set out, where

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one of the thinges, that serueth most for this purpose, is the consideration of the benefits of Almighty God, and of our sins, herein ought hee principally to exercise himselfe, according as wee haue in that place declared.

               </head>
               <p>HAVING alreadie spoken of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance, it is meete, that we doe now treate of the <hi>most blessed sacrament of the Aultar,</hi> which is wont to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:9371:227"/> after it. And here I should first treate of the vertue and wonderfull effects of this most holy sacrament: But for so much as in this matter there is very much to be saide, and the breuity of this <hi>Memoriall</hi> can not beare so long a discourse: I will therefore treat only of the preparation that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of those, that come to receiue this most holie Misterie. For this is of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that looke what preparatiō shall be made for the receauing of it, such shall the grace be, which shalbe giuen vnto him proportionablie by the same. This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of infinite vertue, as well because it containeth in it Christ our Sauiour, God and Man, (who is the fountaine of grace,) as also because by receauing him, there is Communicated here vnto vs the vertue of his Passion, which is of infinite valew.<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Aultar worketh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paration o<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </note> And for this cause, how much greater the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration shalbe, whē we come to receaue him, so much the greater shall the grace be, which by the receauing shalbe graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs. We see, that hee which goeth to fetch water out of the Sea, the greater his vessell is, the more water hee bringeth with him: for as he cannot want water by reason of any scarcitie in the Sea, and yet may want it by reason of the littlenes of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:9371:228"/> his vessell: euen so it fareth with them, that come to receaue this diuine Sacrament, which is the Sea of all graces. And thus is that verse of the Psalme<note place="margin">
                     <hi>salme.</hi> 80 11.</note> here verified, that saieth. Open the mouth of thy hart, and I will fill euerie voide place in the same.</p>
               <p>It is also a <hi>Rule of Philosophie,</hi> that all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses doe worke according vnto the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,<note place="margin">

And therefore fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in dry wood, &amp; not in greene wood, by reason that the one is apt to take fire, and not the other. Wherefore, sith that Christ is present in this Sacrament, who is the general cause of all graces, it is certaine that according vnto the disposition he shal find in the soule, that receaueth him, euen so will he worke in the same, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his grace vnto him. This do al those that doe celebrate, and communicate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times, trie to be true by experience. For they proue it daily, that such deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fruit is obteined by this most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament, as the preparation is, wherewith they come vnto it.</p>
               <p>And not only the hope of this fruit, but also the feare of our own domage ought to make vs diligent in preparing of our soules thereunto. For it is agenerall Rule in
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:9371:228"/> all the Sacraments of the law of grace,<note place="margin">The Holie Sacraments be hurtfull to them that receaue thē vnworthily.</note> that they be of exceeding great profit to him, that receaueth thē worthily, euen so they may be occasion of exceeding great hurt vnto him, that receaueth them vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And agreable hereunto saieth a Holie Father, that as the Sun, the water, and the aier, doe helpe the plantes to increase, and bring foorth fruit, when they haue life, and are well rooted in the earth, but if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise they be not liuely, &amp; wel rooted, thē the very selfe same causes and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do drie them vp, &amp; cause thē to wither the sooner: euen so likewise this most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sacrament of the Aultar, (which is the cause of al graces) maketh those soules, that are liuely, &amp; rooted in Charity, to increase and wax better, &amp; better, but cōtrariwise, those soules, that are not so rooted, the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they receaue, the more are they blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; hardened, &amp; wax worse and worse. And this commeth not by meanes of the blessed sacrament, but through their owne euil preparatiō: the which thing is also ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable vnto the nature of this most holy sacrament, (which is indeed the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual food of the soule.) For as the corporal meat doth sustaine &amp; nourish mens bodies that are sound, and in health, but causeth great
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:9371:229"/> hurt to the same bodies, when they are diseased, &amp; full of corrupt humors, (by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion wherof the Phisitions at such times vse to prescribe vnto their Patients fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; keeping of diet,) euen in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth this diuine meate worke: which for this cause is true life to some, &amp; by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion it may be death vnto others, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the diuersitie of their good, and euill dispositions, and preparations.</p>
               <p>But what preparation that ought to be, which is required for the receauing of this so high a Misterie, euen the selfe same Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losphie and naturall order telleth vs. For we see, that naturall formes, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent they be, the more noble dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is required for the same. As it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euidently in the very same corporall meat, whereof we speake before: the which is first digested and prepared in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, to goe vnto the liuer, and there is disposed with an other more noble forme of blood, to runne to the heart: where it is last of all disposed with an other more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forme to passe vnto the braine where it receaueth his last perfection. So that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of these three places it is fined, and made more perfect, to attaine vnto an other more Noble forme. And this is done in such order, that the perfection
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:9371:229"/> of the forme that goeth before, is a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition for that which commeth after. And that which is the end of the one, is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positiō to the other. Euen so likewise must we presuppose, that this very same order &amp; proportion is required in spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and especially in the Sacraments: the which, the more excellent they are; the greater preparation and puritie is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the receauing of them. For some sacraments are such,<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the more excellent they are, the greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is required to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the receauing of them.</note> that to receaue them worthliy, it sufficeth only to be sorrowfull and truely repentant for our sinnes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any necessitie of Confessing them: but rhis most blessed Sacrament of the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, whereof we now speake, is of so great puritie, and excellency, (because it contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it Almightie God himselfe,) that, besides the premisses, it requireth for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration an other Sacrament, which is the Sacrament of Confession: when there hath bin any deadlie sinne committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Yea,<note place="margin">Confession is requisite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</note> and moreouer besides Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to receaue it more worthily, it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an actuall deuotiō &amp; reuerence: the which deuotion cannot be had without an actuall attention &amp; consideration of such thinges as appertaine vnto God, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is meete to sequester from our soule
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:9371:230"/> for that time all imaginations and cares of worldlie affaires,<note place="margin">Solitarines of the soule.</note> to the end, that it maie more freely and without impediment, fixe her mind vpon Almightie God vvhereby it appeareth, that a man should not at that present content him-selfe with going free and clensed from al sinnes, but that he should endeuour also to go free and cleane from all those thoughts, and cares, that might be anie impediment to this attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and deuotion. The which thing is very liuely represented vnto vs, by that solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, which <hi>Moises</hi> vsed, when he went vp into the hil to speake with Almighty God, vnto whome Commaundement was giuē, that he alone should goe vp to the topp of the mountaine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 24.</note> and that in all partes about the hill there should appeare none other, neither man, nor beast, great, nor small, but only he him selfe alone. And our Lord added also vnto this solitarines a certaine great cloud, and darknes, wherin <hi>Moises</hi> should enter, and talke with him: to the end, that whilest he was speaking with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, as well the cloud, as the soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie place, should take from his sight all that, which was not God. For in this wise ought he to approach vnto this lord, that wil worthily come vnto him: to wit, with a mind so solitary, so closely recollected, so
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:9371:230"/> forgetfull of al earthly things, and so attēt and rauished in God, that during that time it might seeme vnto him, that there is none other thing in the world, but onlie God &amp; him selfe. This verie same thing the said Prophet <hi>Moises</hi> signified vnto vs, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his shooes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 5.</note> and standing barefoot vpon the ground, when Almightie God appeared vnto him. For whosoeuer will come vnto Almightie God, he must goe likewise barefoot, and stripped cleane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from al worldlie &amp; transitory affaires. And although this seeme impossible to mans nature, yet vnto Charitie and vnto the grace of God it is not so. For as the spouse saieth in the Canticles:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 6.</note>
                  <hi>Loue is as strog as death.</hi> So that like as corporal death maketh a man with out sence of al worldly things:<note place="margin">The force of charitie, and of the loue Of God.</note> euen so perfect Charitie possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in such sort the hart of man, and so trās<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formeth it vnto God, that it causeth it to forgett all other things besides God.</p>
               <p>I know right wel, that this death is not for al persōs, but only peculiar for this heauēly spouse, (to wit, for that soule, that deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this name and dignitie.) Neuertheles it is required, and commended vnto all persons, for the dignitie, and excellencie of this diuine Sacramēt: the which as it is the bread
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:9371:231"/> bread of Angels, so it requireth the purity of Angels for the receiuing of it. But for al that our Lord is well contented, if we haue but some part of that purity: that is to say, if we endeuour to do as much as lieth in vs to haue at that time this forgetfulnes of all things, and this actual deuotion and attē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto him. And now to treat of this preparation more particularly, I say, that he, that wil come to receaue this most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Sacrament, as he ought to doe, must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring with him these things follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing.</p>

               <head>The first thing, that is required in him, that will receaue this most blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: is, to haue a cleane and pure conscience <hi>THE II CHAPTER.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE first thing, that is requisite for the worthie receiuing of this most blessed Sacrament, is, that aman doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with all humilitie, that no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of men, nor of Angels, is sufficient to make this preparation, vnlesse the hād of Almightie God doe come betwene, &amp; doe speciallie helpe vs therein. For as no man can dispose himselfe for the increasing
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:9371:231"/> of grace, without grace: euen so no man can dispose himselfe to receaue Almightie God worthilie, without the special helpe of God himselfe. And therefore he must be cried and called vpon with humble &amp; feruent desires, that it may please him with his owne hand to cleanse and prepare the house, wherin he himselfe shalbe lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We see, that when aking intendeth to lodge in a village, he looketh not that the owner of the house should prouide him a lodging, according as the maiestie of his princely entertainmēt requireth, (because the poore inhabitor of that place is not of ability to do it,) but the king himself send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before his harbingers, and purueiours, with such furniture and ornamēts of hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, as are seemely for his roiall person. The which being so, we haue iust cause to become humble suters vnto our Lord, that sith he wil of his great goodnes, &amp; mercie, vouchsafe to lodge in our cottage, that it may please him, in respect of this benefit, to graunt vs an other benefit, that is, to send the Holie Ghost with furniture of all his vertues &amp; heauēly gifts: to the end, that af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter this sort, through the grace and vertue of Almighty God, the house in which god himself must be lodged, may be decked, &amp;
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:9371:232"/> prepared. Now that this may be done, as it behoueth the first thing that is requisite thereunto, is cleannes of conscience: that is to say,<note place="margin">We must be cleane from all deadly sinne, when we come to receaue the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Psal. <hi>15.6.</hi>
                  </note> that we goe pure and cleane from all deadly sin: whereof the Prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, saying: <hi>I will wash my handes among the Innocents, &amp; will compasse about thine Aultar, O Lord?</hi> Where first he saieth, that he will wash his hands, (to wit, the sinfulnes of his deedes,) and afterwardes, that hee will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Aultar, that is to say, vnto the table of our Lord. And for this verie cause hath the Apostle threatned vs so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly, when he saied: <hi>Whosoeuer shall eate this bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27.29.</note>
                  <hi>and drinke the cup of our Lord vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the bodie and blood of our Lord, &amp;c. For not discerning our Lords body.</hi> By which words <hi>S. Paul</hi> giueth vs to vnderstand, that they that approach to receaue this diuine Misterie, being in deadlie sin, doe commit the like horrible offence, as those Iewes did, that Crucified Christ: forsomuch as both the one and the other doe sin against the selfe same body and blood of Christ, though it be after a diuers sort.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, what other thing can ensue by ioyning together two thinges,<note place="margin">Christ and a sinner can not be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> which are so contrarie one to the other, as Christ, and a sinner, but the corruption of the one by the other: for things that are a like, may
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:9371:232"/> easily be ioyned together: as Iron with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, &amp; water with water: but things, that are contrarie, (as water and fire,) can by no meanes be ioyned together, but that the one will corrupt the other. Wherefore sith that by meane of this most blessed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, man is ioyned with Christ, what other thing is there to be looked for of this ioyning, but the corruption of the weaker part? How shall the good ioyne together with the euill, the cleane with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, the humble with the proude, the meeke with the furious, and the mercifull with the cruell. And therefore it is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that there be some kinde of likenes and resemblance betweene the Christian, and Christ, to ioyne him worthily vnto Christ: all which likenes sin destroieth, whē it is not purged by penance. And although all deadly sins do worke this effect,<note place="margin">Enmitie &amp; dishonestie are most cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the sacrament of the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</note> yet are there two, which doe it chiefly aboue the rest: to wit, hatred, &amp; dishonest vncleane life, the which vices do repugne most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly against the nature of this blessed Sacrament: For as touching the first, this blessed Sacrament is a Sacrament of loue, and of vnion: forsomuch as in the same the faithfull doe participate of one very same meate, and of one verie same Spirite,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:9371:233"/> which maketh al the faithfull one same thing through loue. And to signifie this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>S. Augustine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</note> saieth, that our Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted this most Holy Sacrament in such kind of thinges, that of many become one, as bread and wine, (for bread is made of manie graines of wheate, and wine of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie grapes,) to giue vs thereby to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that this diuine Sacrament, which is ministred in those two kindes, worketh this same effect in al such, as receaue it worthily: That is to say, it maketh of many hartes one hart, by communicating vnto them al one same spirit, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it. Which thing being so, what can be more absurd, than to come to receaue a Sacrament of vnion with a hart deuided? vvhat is this els,<note place="margin">How hatred and enmitie be contrarie to this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but to desire the Surgeon to close vp the wound, &amp; thou on the other side to labour alwaies to keepe it opē? sure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, it is no lesse absurd for vs to come to receaue this spirituall medicine (which hath uertue to close vp the vvoundes of hatred, and euill vvill, and to ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe the harts which are deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,) if we on the other side doe intend of set purpose to resist this benefit, and with particular enmity &amp; dissention to breake the vnion of peace, which this medicine worketh</p>
               <pb n="484" facs="tcp:9371:233"/>
               <p>He then, that will auoide this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let him not aduenture to approach vnto this Holy Table, vnlesse he doe first resolue with himselfe to fulfill that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandemēt of our Sauiour, where he saith. <hi>If thou doe offer vp thine offering before the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and shalt there remember,</hi>

               <p>THE third thing that is required for the worthie receauing of this most holy Sacrament, is an actuall deuotion: for it is to be noted, that this most reuerend Sacrament, (as likewise all the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,) haue one effect common, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother proper.<note place="margin">The cōmon effect of all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes is to giue grace. But the proper effect of the sacrament of the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall refection.</note> The common effect is to giue grace: (which is likewise the effect of all the other Sacramentes of the law of grace) But the proper effect of this most holie Sacrament is that, which the diuines call <hi>Spirituall refection:</hi> which is a new force and power to be able to doe good workes. It is also a certaine taste and sweetnesse of heauenly thinges, which in this most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament is imparted vnto vs: For like as the corporall meate doth not onlie sustaine the life of the eater, but giueth him also strength and taste in the eating: euen so this diuine meat doth not only preserue the spirituall life by meanes of the grace vvhich it giueth: but it giueth also, by
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:9371:239"/> the proper vertue of the same, strength to the spirit,<note place="margin">Summa. <hi>S.</hi> Thome. <hi>3.</hi> part. quest. <hi>79.</hi> Art. <hi>1.</hi> in responsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ad se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum.</note> &amp; delight to the taste. And this delight (as Saint Thomas saieth) is so great (I meane vnto those, that haue purged the taste of their soules,) that no manner of words be able to expresse it Because here is tasted the spirituall sweetnes in the very originall fountaine it selfe, which is Christ our Sauiour, the fountaine of all sweetnes.</p>
               <p>Now to enioy this so great a benefit, I say, that there is especially required to be had an actuall deuotion: For sith that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the forme, and the preparation for the same, there ought to besome resemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance: certainely, there cannot be any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration more conuenient to receaue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of deuotion, than to goe to receaue it with actuall deuotion. As we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the best preparation, that wood may haue to take fire; is to prouide, that it be hoat, &amp; drie: which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the fire it selfe.</p>
               <p>And if yee shall demaund of mee, what this actuall deuotion is: I know not how I may better expresse it, thā by saying, that it is, as it were, the water of Angels: the which as it is distilled of diuers sweet odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous hearbes, so hath it many diuers, &amp; very sweet sauours.<note place="margin">What actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deuotion is.</note> For this deuotion is a

                  </note> saith. <hi>With what Contrition, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, with what fountaines of teares, with what feare and reuerence, with what chastitie of bodie, and with what purity of spirit, ought this diuine Misterie to be celebrated (O my almighty God,) where thy flesh is truely eaten, &amp; thy blood truely drunkē: where high thing are ioyned with low thinges, and heauenly thinges, with earthlie thinges: where the Holy Angels are present: and where thou thy selfe art after an inestimable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, both the Priest, and the Sacrifice. Who can thē worthely handle this Misterie, if thou Lord, doe not make him worthie?</hi>

True it is, that it is the bread of angels: but it is also the bread of penitents. True it is, that it is meate for the healthfull: but it is also a medicine for the sicke.

               <p>NOVV that a man maie prepare him selfe after this sort, it shalbe needfull for him to take certaine daies before he come to receaue this most blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: to the intent that in this time he may occupie himselfe, as well in these holie con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>siderations, as in purifiyng and clensing of his conscience, by meanes of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and repentance for his sinnes, and by a Sacramental Confession of them, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the presumption of some Priestes is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to be reproued, that doe vse with out any preparation at all, sodainely to go and say <hi>Masse,</hi> yea, when they haue stood before babling, &amp; lawghing, or haue bene otherwise occupied in worldly affaires, &amp; distractions. So that euē with the like care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les mind, as they would go to eate a peece of commō bread,<note place="margin">Such Priests as doe saie Masse with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration ttke litle pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit thereby.</note> with the same they come vnto our Lordes Table, to eate the bread of Angels, which is very great irreuerēce▪ And this is one of the causes, whie after that they haue vsed this diuine medicine so many yeares continually, they are foūd notwithstanding to haue taken litle profit by the vse therof. For otherwise, if they had so often as they saied <hi>Masse,</hi> receaued
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:9371:250"/> great increase of grace, it is manifest, that after saying Masse for the space of twentie yeres, they should haue gathered together a great tresure of diuine graces. The which doth not so appeare, that we may see it: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as they are alwaies after one like sort: to wit, as sensuall, and as vndeuout, as euer they haue bin before, yea, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times farre worse. What thing is thē more to be feared, thā to come euery day to the fountaine of grace, to the table of Angels, &amp; to the shop of all heauenly medicines, and yet after the continuance of so many yeares to be as barren, &amp; voide of vertues, as full of frailtie, and humane passions, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they were before?</p>
               <p>Some euill Christians also are no lesse worthy of reprehension, than these: who, when they haue liued in all kinde of vices, and disorder, doe come at the end of the yeare to Confession, and hauing scarcely well finished their vomite of a thousand kindes of abhominations and sinnes, they runne immediatly after their arising from their Ghostly Fathers feete to our Lordes Table, and there doe eate the bread of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: for the receauing whereof it were needfull to haue (if it were possible for vs) euen the purity of angels. Now were it not
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:9371:250"/> a thing conuenient to bestow before, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes in pacifying of almighty God, &amp; in washing and watering with teares the house, wherein he must be lodged? Were it not reason to celebrate the <hi>Vigile</hi> before the <hi>Feast,</hi> and to prepare our selues before hand for so great a solemnity? For if when the people of Israel should receaue the law of God, <hi>Moyses</hi> commaunded them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 19.20 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.</note> that they should prepare thēselues three daies before, &amp; wash their garments, &amp; abstaine frō the company of their wiues,<note place="margin">Cleannes of body requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this most blessed Sacrament.</note> how much more ought this now to be done, for the receauing of Almighty God himselfe, who is the giuer, not only of the law, but also of grace, which is more than the law? Why will any man then, when as yet the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his sinnes past are bleeding fresh, and the stench of so great filthines sauoring so ranke, come so rashly vnto a Mistery of so great purity, and to receaue a Lord of so great Maiestie.</p>
               <p>This is a great abuse, &amp; very much vsed of many persons: the which he that would esteeme it as it is, not weighing the matter with the waights of Canaan,<note place="margin">

This reuerence ought to be directed in such sort, that during

For like as the Sunne giueth light to the world, not only when it riseth, but also an hower before it appeareth, and an other hower after his going downe: euen so the Sunne of iustice, which is conteined in this most Holie Sacrament, doth not onlie illuminate our soules at the time of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, but also both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue receaued him: before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing, with the hope to receaue him: and afterwardes with the remembrance of the benefit receaued.</p>
                  <p>That we may doe this with the greater facility, here are set forth certaine <hi>Praiers,</hi> and <hi>Meditations,</hi> as well <hi>in the end of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tise,</hi> as also in the <hi>fifte Treatise of this Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,</hi>

               <p>And for the better vnderstanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it must be considered, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the law of Grace, be as it were certaine conduit pipes from heauen, by which the graces of the holy ghost are cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied vnto vs:<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are conduit pipes where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by the grace of God is conueied vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs.</note> the which doe originallie proceed and take their first beginning out of the fountaine of the side of our Sauiour Christ. And therefore, <hi>he that goeth to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:9371:263"/> ought</hi> (as <hi>S. Chrisostome</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. <hi>Chrisost.</hi>
                  </note> saith) <hi>to make account, that hee goeth to put his mouth vnto the wound of his pretious side, and to drinke out of the same the water of life.</hi> The Sacramentes are medicines, &amp; remedies, to cure our frailty, and weakenes: the which was well known to him that was sent vnto the world as a Phisition to heale the same, and therefore he knew right well, how to prouide such thinges, as were requisite for the curing of such diseases: for it was not reason, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many kindes of medicines to cure our bodies,<note place="margin">Our soules be subiect vnto sinnes, as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to diseases.</note> there should be none to cure our soules: sith they be no lesse subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diseases, than our bodies, and it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs to be no lesse carefull to seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for the curing of them, but rather so much the more, by how much our soules are of greater excellencie, than our bodies. For this end therefore were the <hi>Sacraments of the law of Grace,</hi> instituted: that being (as it is) a perfect law, it is meet, it should ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prouide for all such thinges, as be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for our saluatiō. And for this cause there are many Sacramentes, as there be many and diuers diseases of our soules.</p>
               <p>And not only the Sacramentes of their part doe help in this behalfe, but also that which wee doe of our owne part, for the
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:9371:264"/> worthy receauing of them. For he, that goeth to make his confession, doth first of all accuse himselfe of his sinnes past: and repenteth that, which he hath done: and humbleth himselfe at his Ghostlie Fathers feete, as vnto the vicare of Christ: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth pardon and absolution of his sins: and purposeth fully an amendment of them: and there finally he is receaued of Almighty God againe, and by the handes of the Church reconciled vnto him. The which all doth helpe vs verie much to the well framing and due ordering of our life. For it maketh a man to keepe an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with his conscience, considering that he must so often times render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof in Confession, being in that respecte, as one that walketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene two walles, in such sort, that he can not slippe out of the way, neither on the one side, nor yet on the other: liuing with such a circumspection &amp; care of him selfe, by reason of his Confession past, as also of his Confession to come, that he dare not so easily tread awrie, for to committ any one deadly sinne.</p>
               <p>For this purpose then the Sacrament of confesssō helpeth very much:<note place="margin">Often Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the due orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our life.</note> the necessity whereof mē should more clearely perceaue
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:9371:264"/> if they would at the least make the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate of spirituall matters, as they doe of tēporall: For tell me, why is it necessary to dresse vp thy garden continually, to sweep thy house euery day, and to wash thy shirt euery weeke? Is there any other reason, but because each one of these thinges are ordinarily made foule? Now then, if, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest we liue in this wicked world, the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our soules be so often times spotted, and defiled with sinne: vvhy doe wee not seeke to haue an ordinary remedie for the same, sith that the danger is so ordinarie? Why doe wee not endeuour to wash our soule euery weeke, as we doe our shirt: sith that the cleannesse of the one, importeth more than the cleannesse of the other, by how much more our soule is of more value than our shirt?</p>
               <p>We see also, what an ordinary care the mariners haue to pumpe out the water, which the shippe gathereth in continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and this they doe especially, when it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. For otherwise, in case they should not so doe, the shippe would drinke in so great a quātity of water, that it would sinke to the bottome, and be vtterly destroied. Now if the venial sins be so ordinary,<note place="margin">Veniall sinnes like vnto dropps of water, that fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the shipp.</note> that we commit euery day, the which are as it
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:9371:265"/> were litle droppes of water, that fall into the ship of our soule,) and these do dispose vs vnto deadly sins, wherewith this ship sincketh, and is drowned: were it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to seeke alwaies for the remedy of these smaller sins, least we fall into greater sinnes, whereby all is lost?</p>
               <p>We see likewise, how nature prouideth often times for bodies, that are subiect to grosse, and naughtie humoures, to haue some issue, whereby they are purged: by meanes whereof they liue in health, which otherwise were not able to liue. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the phisitions wil not stop those issues though they can very well doe it, because they wil not take from them this remedy. Now that, which nature hath found out in this case for the remedie of our bodies, the same hath the grace of God prouided for the remedy of our souls: that, wheras there doe breed within them so manie corrupt humours of sinnes, they should haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie to purge them, which is, the issue of Confession, by meanes whereof our soules are purged of al the sinful corruption, that is ingendred in them.</p>

For this most Blessed Sacrament susteineth vs in the spirituall life: it delighteth the inward tast: it restoreth the supernatural forces: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paireth
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:9371:266"/> the vertue, that was weakned: it strengthneth a man against the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the enimie, and causeth him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease euery day more and more, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he attaine vnto his due perfection, if he himselfe through his own default do make none impediment therein.</p>
                  <p>And if thou demaunde, how it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a substance, and corporall meate should worke such a spirituall effect, as to preserue and increase Charitie, and to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine a man in the spiritual life: I answere, that the cause hereof, is the vertue super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall of the Sacraments, which almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God hath instituted for a remedy of our weakenes, and would that vnder the corporal &amp; visible signes, &amp; formes, they should work inuisible effects: as it is cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seene in the water of Holy Baptisme, vvhich in washing the body outwardlie, washeth the soule also inwardly, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it in state of grace. The very same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doth this most blessed Sacrament of the Aultar worke in his manner,<note place="margin">The blessed Sacrament of the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is the greatest of all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> in that, that it is a Sacrament, and the greatest of all Sacraments. But besides all this, it hath also two great prerogatiues aboue all the other Sacraments: by meanes whereof it worketh this effect in a more high degree.
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:9371:266"/> The one is, for that therein ioyntly vvith the flesh of Christ, there is present the soule of Christ, and the eternall word of the liuing God, and the life of all thinges: the which entreth by meanes of this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the soule of him that doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and worketh in the same, this so wonderfull effect, as to giue him the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life. Wherefore, like as a Phisition, that will cure a sicke person with some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable powder, mingleth, and vniteth the same with a little stilled water, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it him to drinke, to the end that the water which is liquid and thin, may carrie the medicine through out all the vaines of the body, (where it must worke his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) euen so hath this heauenly Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ordeined, to vnite the <hi>diuine word</hi> vvith his humane flesh, to the end hee might by this meane enter into men, which are of flesh, &amp; work in them this kind of health, &amp; life. And besides this, not onely the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine word of it selfe, but the very flesh also which he hath vnited vnto him, doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate this same vertue: and so the flesh as the instrument &amp; meane of the <hi>Godhead</hi> to worke by, is the cause of life, as we haue declared before: and therefore our Sauiour whē he had restored the Princes daughter of the
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:9371:267"/> Synagogue to life againe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>Marck.</hi> 5. <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.</note> commaunded meat to be giuen vnto her, to the end that the life, which he had giuen her by his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, might be preserued with meat: giuing vs thereby to vnderstand, that it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise expedient, that vnto those soules, which are raysed againe by the vertue of Almighty God, (who worketh in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confession,) there should be ministred this diuine meat: to the end that the spirituall life, which is restored by one Sacrament, might be preserued by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Whereby wee may perceaue, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary these two Sacramentes are for the <hi>spirituall life:</hi> the one to giue it, &amp; the other to preserue it.<note place="margin">The profit of often con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fession and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating.</note> Wherefore, he that desireth to obteine this spirituall life, must vse to Confesse himselfe oftentimes: and he that mindeth to preserue it, must also Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate oftentimes.</p>
                  <p>And because there are so few in this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt age, that doe Confesse their sinnes, &amp; Communicate oftentimes, therefore are there so many, that die spiritually. And this is also the cause, why the fire of Charity, wherein the spirituall life consisteth,<note place="margin">The cause why charity is so cold in our dayes.</note> is so generally quenched: because there be so many, that will not helpe themselues with
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:9371:267"/> these defensiues, and remedies which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath ordained for this ende.

                     <hi>(which is heauen:)</hi> where being in the presence of the chiefest good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, shee burneth without ceasing in the loue of him: but in this world Charitie is, as it were, a stranger and Pilgrime, and as one that is foorth of her naturall country where she hath a thousand thinges, which are contrary vnto her. Wherfore she hath need of great helpes, preseruatiues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiues for her conseruation. We see that a droppe of water, that is cast into the Sea, endureth for euer: because it is in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Element, wherin it is preserued with the other water, which is of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it is of. But cast the same vpon the ground, and it will be quickly dried vp, by reason of the naturall drinesse of the earth, which is contrary to the water. A Cittie likewise that is scituated in the hart &amp; mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a Kingdome, standeth safe from eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hath no need of Souldiers or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons to defend it: but the Citty, that is on the frontieres of a Kingdome, if it be not well walled, yea, &amp; defended with diligent watch &amp; ward, in time it will be lost. Now
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:9371:268"/> in the like danger is Charity in this world: where she is out of her naturall country, &amp; where shee hath many enimies, against whome that mighty Emperour, (who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued this right well,) hath prouided for her defence, and preseruation, this most Holy Sacrament, whereof those wordes of the Psalme may be vnderstood very apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Psa. <hi>22.5.</hi> Parasti in conspectu meo mēsam aduersus eos qui tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulant me.</note> which say: <hi>Thou haste prepared a Table in my sight O Lord,</hi> (which giueth me vertue &amp; strength) <hi>against them that persecute me.</hi> Now if euery one of vs be subiect to the assaults of these enimies: what shall we be able to doe without the helpe, and succour of this Table, which Almighty God hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs for this end? <hi>Woe be vnto them,</hi> saieth S.

For as grace is giuen therein, so the oftener it is re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaued, the more grace is giuen.

                  <p>This is likewise proued by the differēce, which <hi>Saint Gregorie</hi> putteth betwene the tast of spiritual delights, (such as is the tast of this heauenly meat,) &amp; the tast of world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and sensual delights: the which differēce

But contrariwise, the spirituall delights, when they be not had, are not desired: because they are not knowen.

<pb n="570" facs="tcp:9371:276"/> It chaūceth (saith he) sometimes vnto spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall persōs, that the more they labor for the grace of deuotion, (which they tearme sensible deuotion,) the lesse they finde it: &amp; the more speed they make to attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, the farther off they are frō it: as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth vpō the principal feasts of the yere, at which times deuotion is most sought for: &amp; especially when they prepare them selues to receaue the blessed Sacrament of the Aultar. And many vpon this occasion are exceeding sad, &amp; pensiue, &amp; of a pusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity of mind doe imagine, that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture it is not the will of almighty God, that they being in this case should approch vnto him, or that Almightie God driueth them away from him, as vnworthie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue this diuine sacrament: whereupon it chaunceth sometimes, that for this cause they withdraw themselues, and refraine from receauing the medicine and remedy of their health, which is this most holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Of the which there may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny causes, some by default of the partie, &amp; some without any defalt of his,<note place="margin">Ouer ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest seeking after deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall dispensation of almighty God. But as touching our present matter, one of the most cōmon causes is, when they will seek for deuotiō vpon such daies with excessiue force, and
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:9371:277"/> and vehemencie. For by this meane it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the soule is depriued of her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and that the force of nature is suffo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cated, when a man laboureth beyond his reach, to gette out the ioyce of deuotion by way of violence, as it were with wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; pressing. And if he cannot obteine it foorthwith, as he desireth, thē is he very much molested, &amp; greiued for it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōeth more hardened, &amp; more vnable for the same. Wherupon it commeth to passe, that the more earnestly he laboureth to gette it, the lesse he obteineth it and the more drie he waxeth: according as it is written.<note place="margin">

We see that the ioice of an orrange or of other things, cōmeth not out so pure, when it is squised with ouermuch maine force as when it is wrong with moderatiō, to yeeld so much, as may easily begotten out of it. The like hapeneth to them, that striue in such sort for deuotion. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it followeth, that the more the harte is at liberty, the more sweete, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant is the affection of deuotion, &amp; this is the cause why it happeneth, that a- man is more deuout at other times, than vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on high principall Feasts. For it seemeth,
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:9371:277"/> that vpon these daies we doe enforce, and as it were choke vp the spirit with ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much carefulnes, and vehemencie of this desire.

The first cause is the wāt of due preparation before they come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue this most blessed Sacrament.</note> why some that doe say <hi>Masse,</hi> &amp; Communicate oftentimes we cannot yet see them to haue taken such profit, either in deuotion, or in other vertues: but rather to continue all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in a manner in one selfe same slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and negligence: a certaine Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answereth thus. This effect, saieth he (to speake ordinarily) is wont to happen through one of these two causes. The one is, by the default of their euel preparation, as we saied before of the want of deuotion. This is, because they goe to receaue this most blessed Sacrament, not with such a feruour of Charity, and hunger of this hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly bread, as they ought to doe: but for a kinde of custome, ceremonie, fulfilling of duety, or necessity: and after that they haue receaued it, they set open the gates foorthwith, and vnloose their tongue, and hart, vnto all their appetites, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:9371:278"/> reason or restraint at al. So that they neither prepare them selues with such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, as is requisite, before they receaue, nor yet doe they fore-see and take such great care and diligence ouer them selues, after the time they haue receaued, as they should doe. And therfore it is no maruaile if some doe arise from that heauenly table with as litle deuotion, as they went vnto it or at least doe receaue with very litle fruit: for so much as their preparation was so slē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, before they came vnto it. The which is confirmed by that, which we haue saied in the beginning of this treatise: that is, that all causes doe worke according vnto the disposition, which they find in the matter, or subiect. And so this most diuine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the fountaine of all graces, doth likewise worke according vnto the disposition, which it findeth in the soules of the receauers. And therefore it worketh lesse in those soules, that are lesse well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the receauing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The second cause is the want of due mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our pas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sions.</note>The other cause is, by reason of some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret defects and passions not wel mortified that mē haue in their soules, the which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions doe hale them, &amp; carry them a way after their appetites: and so they be great lettes &amp; impediments vnto their spirituall

                  </label> vnto this question of the one side is very easy, and of the other side of great difficultie. For if we doe only consider the vertue &amp; efficacie of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (forsomuch as our Sauiour Iesus Christ is conteined therein, who is the foū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all graces, and by him is applied vnto vs the vertue of his passion, which is of infinite value) it is a cleare case, that if wee might receaue it infinite times, wee ought so to do: considering that we should receaue so much the more grace, and so much the greater benefits thereby. But on the other side, considering the disposition, and preparation, which this Holie Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requireth, (according vnto vvhich preparation, it Communicateth his vertue, as wee haue declared before, especiallie
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:9371:279"/> this being a Sacrament, not for the dead, but for the liuing: because the eating ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of presupposeth life,) according (I say) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this consideratiō, it is not good to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ouer often: but according vnto the preparation that euery one shall haue for the same: In regard whereof there are many things to be cosidered, &amp; respected.</p>
               <p>And first of all,<note place="margin">Such as be in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous state of life haue bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter meanes to prepare them selues to Communi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cate often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, than Secular per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sons haue.</note> a respect herein must be had vnto the state of euery man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: For such persons, as are dedicated vnto God, (as Priestes, Monkes, Nunnes, and all other Religious, both men, &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,) haue greater prepartion, (in respect of their state of life,) to come vnto this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrament, because they are not incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the affaires, and busines of the world. This I say, as hauing regarde vnto their state of life. Howbeit our Lord doth oftentimes supplie the defect of the state of life, with the aboundance of his grace, the which he giueth to whom he listeth, &amp; as he listeth, in whatsoeuer state of life, a man is called vnto: as we see in <hi>Dauid, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iob,</hi> and other holy Kings, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, which were of great perfection, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their state of life helped them not so much therunto, as the grace of God did. which is able to help more, thā al the helps
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:9371:280"/> of any state of life, be it neuer so perfect.</p>
               <p>Likewise a respect ought to be had, that first euery person doe fulfill his bounden dutie in doing the occupations and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his state of life,<note place="margin">Deuotion ought not to preiudice the bounden duties and charges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in each state of life.</note> wherein hee liueth: that he doe giue himselfe vnto his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exercises in such sort, as that hee leaue not his other bounden duties and charges vndone.

               <p>Wherefore, as well by this, as also by al the other reasons, that haue bin hitherto declared, euery mā may easilie perceaue, how little reason those men haue, which being moued with superfluous zeale, doe vnder colour of reuerence condemne, yea and preach also many times, against such persons, as doe frequent the Sacraments: For put the case, that there were herein some excesse, yet being so many other greater inconuenienees in the world to be reprended, mee seemeth they should not waste so many words against this alone. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if the matter be wel considered, they shall
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:9371:286"/> shal find, that there commeth much more hurt vnto the world, by reason of so muuh refraining from the vse of the Sacraments, than by comming ouermuch vnto them: For the better vnderstanding whereof, it is very much to be noted, that (as <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> sayeth,) all morrall vertues, because they consist in a meane, must necessarilie haue two vices contrarie vnto them: the one by excesse, &amp; the other by defect: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue not at all times names whereby they may be knowen. Euen so also wee say, that in the vse of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; generally in all spiritual exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses there may be both an excesse, &amp; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Now this then being so,<note place="margin">More harme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayning frō the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than of ouermuch frequenting them.</note> if we cast our eyes vpon the greater of these extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we shall finde, that the world is in far worse case by so much refrayning frō the Sacraments, than by comming ouermuch vnto them. For admitt there were a faulte in this behalfe, yet who is so blinde, that he seeth not how much greater fault it is for men to absent themselues so long time frō the sacraments, wherin almighty God hath put the medicine of our woundes, &amp; the remedie of our soules.

<pb n="591" facs="tcp:9371:287"/> themselues from this bread of life? But consider the difference, that is betweene this corrupt age, in which wee doe now liue, (wherein men doe receaue the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament but only once in the yere,) and the deuout time of the Primitiue Church, when the Christians did receaue euery day: &amp; thou shalt thereby perceiue, what difference there is betweene the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of the blessed Sacrament often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and the receauing of it, but onelie once in the yeare.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, let him that hath any zeale to God, and to his Catholicke Church, cry out, and bewaile this slackenes, to see men so to draw backward from God, and from all spirituall exercises: forsomuch as this is the principall cause, yea, &amp; the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all our euils.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, like as those that haue the gouernment of the common weale, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="592" facs="tcp:9371:287"/> than of ouermuch plenty: euen so ought they that haue the charge of the Church, much rather to thinke, how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie and prouide for the want of these spirituall victuals, and medicines, than to remedy the ouermuch aboundance of the same. Forsomuch as without comparison, the inconuenience is greater, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of want, than that which commeth of superfluity. Especially considering, that none can be a meete Iudge in this matter, iudging only by the externall doings, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he see the inward minds withall. And certainely, that man is very rashe, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth sentence vpon the cause, hauing not considered the processe. This may suffice at this present for this matter.</p>
               <p>Now will I set forth here certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout prayers, and meditations, wherein a good Christian may occupy himselfe both before, &amp; after the receauing of this most blessed Sacrament.</p>

               <p>VVHO art thou O my LORD, and who am I, that I should be so bolde as

What other thing is man of himselfe, but a vessell of corruption, a Sonne of the Diuel, an inheritour of Hell, a worker of sinnes, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiser of Almightie GOD, and a creature very weake, and vnable vnto all goodnesse, and verie mightie, and disposed vnto all wickednesse! What is man els, but a miserable creature in all thinges: in his counsailes blinde, in his workes vaine, in his appetites filthy, in his desires inconstant, to be short, in all thinges little, and onely in his owne estimation great? Behold here, O my Lord, what I am! But now, what art thou? Thou art without quantitie great, without qualitie good, without measure wise, and without time euerlasting. Thou art in greatnes infinite, in vertue omnipotent, in wisdome profound, in counsaile wonderfull, in iudgement terrible, and in all vertues perfect, and fully complete. How then may such a vile, and loathsome creature as I am, be so bolde, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach vnto a God of so great a Maiestie? The starres are dimmed in thy presence, the pillars of heauen quake before thee, the highest of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins doe gather in their winges, and account them-selues as it were little flyes, when thou art present.

               <p>But O most mercifull and dreadfull God, how much greater is thy most Blessed Sacrament than that Arke? How much greater thing is it to receiue thee, than to behold thee? How then, shall not I tremble and quake for feare, when I come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a God of so great maiestie, and Iustice: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering, that if I should prepare my selfe for the space of infinit yeares▪ to receiue this most diuine sacrament only once, and should haue all the purity of the Angels for the same, I should not be worthie to receiue it: how much lesse now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so euill disposed as I am?</p>
               <p>And if I haue such cause to feare, considering the greatnes of thy excellent maiestie, much more ought <hi>I</hi> to feare considering my sins, and the malice and wickednes of my life? I remember now, O my Lord how many great offences I haue committed against thee in this world. A time there was, (and I would O my most mercifull Lord, that it were not also euen now,) when the thing most forgottē and least loued of me was thine infinit beautie: and when the dust of creatures was more esteemed of me, than the treasure of thy grace, and the hope of thy glory mine own desires were the law, and
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:9371:290"/> rules, whereby I directed my life. All obedience I gaue vnto myne appetites, and I haue made no more account of thee, than if I had neuer knowen thee.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 13.1.</note> I am that <hi>foolish person, that said in his hart: there is no God.</hi> For in such sort haue I liued a long time, as if I had beleeued, that there were no God at all. I neuer endeuoured my selfe to take paines for the loue of thee. I neuer feared thy iustice. I neuer refrained my selfe from wickednesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of thy lawes. <hi>I</hi> neuer gaue thankes (as <hi>I</hi> should haue done) for thy benefits. And though <hi>I</hi> knew well, that thou waste present in all places, yet <hi>I</hi> neuer left sinning in thy presence. Looke vvhatsoeuer myne eyes fansied, <hi>I</hi> yeelded it vnto them. And <hi>I</hi> neuer vsed the least inforcement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hart to refraine it from anie one of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes. What kinde of wickednesse is there, through which my malice hath not passed? What other thing hath all my life time past beene, but a continuall contradiction and warre against thee, and a renewing of all the martyrdomes and paines vvhich thou haste suffered for mee? How manie times haue I for greedinesse euen of a filthie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or els for couetousnesse of a little money, sold thee as another traiterous Iudas?

What other thing did I (at other times when I receaued thee in thy blessed Sacrament, and so soone as I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued thee, did forth-with turne to offend thee) but laugh thee to scorne vvith the souldiers, who on the one side kneeled downe, and adored thee, and on the other side smote thee on the face with a reede?

I read in thy gospel: that all the diseased and miserable persons came to touch thee, because there issued such vertue from thee, as healed them all.

To thee came the blind, the deafe, and such as were sicke of the palsie, and possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diuells.

<pb n="607" facs="tcp:9371:295"/> ghost. It was more bright than the starres of the Heauens, more pure than the angells of paradise more adorned with vertues and graces than both Heauen, and earth, withall other ornamentes: and therefore it was a lodgeing worthily prepared for almighty God. But that the same Lord should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite in my house, which is more dirty than the mire it selfe, more obscure than the night, more filthie, than all the stincking puddles in the world: is not this a matter of great wonder? &amp; admit, that through his infinit goodnes, I am at this presente washed, and cleansed with the water of his grace, and vertue of his Sacramentes: yet not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is it not a wonderfull mercie, that a Lorde of such excellent purity, and cleannes, as he is, shold not disdaine a thing, that hath benne sometimes so filthy and lothsome? it were an offence vnto a great Lord, in case one should serue him at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with some vessell, that had serued before in some sicke house, to receaue the vomitte of sicke folkes, or other like filthines, although afterwards it were washed very cleane, and made whiter than snowe: because the remembrance of the filthines past it sufficient to cause a lothsomnes in him, that should see it. But, O my Almightie God, and my Sauiour, what greater mercie can there be shewed, thā for thee not to loth, that there should be at thy table: among thy other elected vessells, a vessel of corruption, and of al filthines, for thee to eate vpō? for although it be now clensed with thy grace, yet there continueth the fresh remembrance of sinne, and the abhominable sauour with the reliques of sinne, which after the same sin doe remaine in the soule. vvhy dost thou then consent, that such a stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vessel, as I am, should be at thy table, and that it should be as it were a pixe to lay this <hi>blessed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:9371:295"/> Host</hi> in? let the angels praise thee, &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thee, O Lord, for so high a fauour, for so preat a mercie, and for so excellent a worke, and shewe of thy goodnes. It appeareth right well, that thou art the most excellent and perfect goodnes, sith thou takest so great delight to communicate thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and sith thou hast deuised such a wonderfull meane to make vs good. It appeareth right well, how passing great thy loue is towards men,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.6.7.</note> &amp; that Charity (as the Apostle saieth) is neither ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor disdainfull, nor seeketh her owne, in that thou takest no disdaine at so filthy a thing, as the hart of a sinner is.</p>
               <p>But how strange a matter shal it seeme, if vnto all this there be adioyned al that also, which this wō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diuine sacrament doth worke, and signifie. O how great and how ioyful newes O Lord, doth this reuerēd mistery giue me of thee? such vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, as may for their worthines throughlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and satisfie my hart. This most blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment assureth me of thy name, that thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; not only my father, but also the most sweet spouse of my soule. For I vnderstand, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect for the which thou hast instituted this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Sacrament, is to susteine and delight soules with spirituall delightes, and to make them one with thee. Now if this be so, if it be true also, that the heart is to be iudged by the workes: from vvhat kinde of heart proceeded such a worke as this is? for vnion properly appertaineth vnto such, as are marryed: and cherishinges are not wont to be vsed of the maister towardes his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, but of the housband towardes his wife: no cherishings are not wont to be shewed of a father towards his son, vnlesse he be his yōgest son &amp; very tēderly beloued of his father, for to such a father it
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:9371:296"/> appertaineth to prouide for his sonne, not onelie of thinges necessarie for to liue, but also of gestes, and other delightfull things, wherewith hee may make him merrie and ioyfull for his recreation. Such an effect of loue as this is, remained O Lord, to be discouered to the world: and this was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vntill the time of thy comming, and vntil the preaching of the good tidinges of the Ghospell. So that in other kindes of thy Sacraments &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitts thou giuest mee to vnderstand, that thou art my King and my Sauiour, my Pastour, and my Aduocate, my Phisitian, my Master, my Tutor, my Redeemer, and my Protectour, finally my Lord, and my God: but in this most blessed Sacrament, (wherein it is thy pleasure by an vnspeakeable wise to vnite thy selfe with my soule, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it with such meruailous delightes,) thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest me most manifestly to vnderstand, that thou art the bridegroome of my soule, that thou art my Father,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.</note> yea and such a Father, as doth most tenderly loue his Sonne, as <hi>Iacob</hi> loued <hi>Beniamin</hi> aboue all his Children. This giueth mee to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the effect of thy Holy Sacrament, and these are the good tidinges, which it signifieth to me of thee. There is no doublenes, O Lord, in any of thy workes. Looke what they shew out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, the same haue they also within. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by this effect <hi>I</hi> vnderstand the cause: by this worke <hi>I</hi> iudge thy heart: by this entertainement, and consolation, which thou giuest me, <hi>I</hi> take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to vnderstand what a louing heart thou bearest towards me. Now then, what greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit? what greater grace? what greater loue could there be shewed, than for thee to graunt mee to receaue thee this day O my Sauiour, in this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament?

With what kind of loue shal I loue thee for this so inestimable a benefit, if I meane to answere this loue which thou hast here shewed vnto me? If thou being my Creatour, and my Redeemer, doest loue me in this wise, that am a most vile and wretched worme: why shall not <hi>I</hi> loue thee, that art the most high, and most noble Spouse of my soule? <hi>I</hi> will loue thee therefore, O my Lord: I wil desire thee: <hi>I</hi> will eat thee &amp; drink thee. O sweetnes of loue! O loue of inestimable delight, let my soule eate thee, and let my bowels be replenished with the most pleasant liquour of thy sweetnes! O Charitie! O my God! O sweet honey! O most pleasant milke! O meat most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable, and meate for the mighty, make mee to grow in thee, that I may worthily reioyce in thee! O satiety and delight of my will! O loue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of my heart, why am not I wholly inflamed &amp; burned in the fire of thy loue? why am not I whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trāsformed (as the iron in the fornace) into loue, in such sort, that there remaine nothing in me, but only loue?

O amorous prison, why am not I taken, and fast bounde in this Chaine, &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vvith this darte, and burned with this fire, in such sorte, that my bowels may burne, and be wholly consumed in loue? O yee children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> A generation of men blinde, and deceaued: What doe ye? Whither goe ye? What seeke ye after? If ye seek after loue, here is the most sweet,

If yee seeke after delights, here be the most pleasant, the most strong, &amp; the most chast delights that may be. If ye seeke after riches, here is the treasure of heauen, the price of the world: and the mayne sea of all goodnnsse. If yee seeke after honour here is Almighty God himselfe, and with him all the Court of heauen, which commeth to visite you. What greater honour can there be, than to haue such a guest in my house, and all the Court of heauen about him? If a King goe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, and doe chaunce to eate in an hostery, it is certaine, that all that house is beset with his Gard, and Nobles, that come to attend vpon him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, sith Almighty God by meanes of this blessed Sacrament entereth into my soule, certainly <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the day in which <hi>I</hi> receaue him, all the Court of heauen is about him, waiting vpon him, and adoring him, euen as they adore him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>

He that hath receaued almighty God in to his house, it is not meet that hee should receaue any vaine thing into the same.

Now then, if so wise a King would not suffer that his owne wife, being a wife of so Princely estate, should set her feete in that place where the Arke of God had beene, for that she was of the linage of the Gentiles: how shall <hi>I</hi> suffer, that any thing of the Gentiles, to wit, any prophane &amp; worldlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires should enter into my hart, where God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath bin? How shall that bed receaue the thoughts and desires of Gentiles, and of worldlie men where God himselfe doth lodge. How shall

Besides al this, it hath pleased thee, to discouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my soule in this diuine sacrament the loue of a housbād towards his spouse, &amp; to deale with me, as with such a one. Graunt me therefore O Lord, the very same hart towardes thee: that I may so loue thee with a faithfull loue, with a chast loue, with an inward loue, and with a stronge and harty loue, that nothing may be able to seperat me at any time from thee. O most sweete housband of my soule, stretch forth, I besech thee, those most sweet and amorous armes, and embrace it in such wise with thee, that I may neuer be seperated frō thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in life, nor yet in death. For this vnion sake thou hast ordained this most blessed Sacrament: because thou knowest right well, how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is for the creature to remaine in thee, than in it selfe. For in thee it remaineth, as in God: but in it selfe it remaineth as in a fraile creature.

               <p>VVHEN a man is now conuerted vnto Almightie God vvith all his heart, and hath procured the purifying and cleansing of his soule by meanes of these two Sacraments, of the vvhich wee haue treated here before, it remaineth that he doe forthwith applie all his care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the amendment, and well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his life: whereof we will now treate in the Rules following.<note place="margin">Grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth frō lesse perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to more perfection.</note> And because grace followeth commōly the orderly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Nature, vvhich proceedeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in her vvorkes from lesse to more: that is to say, from lesse perfection to more perfection:<note place="margin">Two Rules of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an life.</note> therefore we will likewise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this doctrine, giuing two Rules, &amp; orders of life: the one for such as beginne newly to serue God, &amp; haue a desire to be saued: &amp; the other for such, as doe besides this, desire to increase, and profitt, euerie
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:9371:301"/> day more and more in the way of vertue.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderstanding whereof, it is to be considered, that all this doctrine of good life, the Prophet Dauid hath apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuided into two principall parts.<note place="margin">Psa. <hi>33.15</hi> Declina a malo, &amp; fac bonum.</note> The one is in not doing euill, and the other in doing good: that is to say, the one in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing from the soule all kinde of vices: and the other in furnishing and adorning it with all kinde of vertues. This is the clearest, and most perfect diuision, that might be giuen in this matter. For by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of these two points, a man becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a new man, and a new creature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying with the first part, the Image of the old and earthly Adam, and reforming with the second, the Image of the new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, which is our Sauiour Iesus Christ. And withall, by this meane hee commeth to be a man supernaturall, and diuine. For as hee was created for a diuine and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall end: (which is to see Almightie God in his own glorie, &amp; excellency,) euē so the life, that disposeth him to this end ought to be also supernaturall, &amp; diuine: sith that (according vnto the Rules of Philosophie,) the end, and the meanes thereunto ought to be of one selfe-same order,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Phisic. T.</hi> 23.</note> and proportion.</p>
               <pb n="620" facs="tcp:9371:301"/>
               <p>And although in the exercise and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise both of life and doctrine,<note place="margin">Vices can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of vertues.</note> these two thinges goe alwaies ioyntly together, (for vices can not be conquered without the helpe of vertues,) yet to giue more light vnto the matter, and for the plainer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the doctrine, wee will seperate (so much as is possible) the one from the other. In like manner it is meete to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised here, that among such thinges, as are conteined as well in this rule as in al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like, some are of bounden dutie, and some of will, or of perfection: that is to say, some are <hi>of Commaundement,</hi> as the Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God, and of his Church: and some <hi>of Counsaile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Among the thinges that are proposed vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, some are of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and some of counsaile.</note> as all other thinges, that are counsailed vs in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: the which counsailes doe help vs, for the better fulfilling of such thinges as are giuen vs in Commaundement,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.34.35. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15 16.</note> and also to attaine vnto greater perfection. This is very necessary to be aduertised, to the end that a man may vnderstand, what hee is bound to doe of necessity, and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of his will, and that hee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in what degree each of these things is required of him, (that hauing this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement he may vse greater diligence in such things, as hee is bound of dutie to
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:9371:302"/> doe, than in others, which be but only vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie,) and that he may also neuer leaue the one vndone for the other, (as wee see some doe:) which is a great abuse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. And for this cause it shall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the beginning of this rule, what wee are bound to doe of dutie, (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in very few wordes:) &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes many other things shall be added, which doe help to the fulfilling of them, &amp; to the obtaining of greater perfection. For although the keeping of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes doe suffice vnto saluation: yet, because in the way of God, a man should neuer take contentation in his owne doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor say, I haue sufficiently performed my dutie: therefore many other thinges shall be here adioyned besides the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall things,<note place="margin">A man may not take a contentatiō in his owne doings.</note> for the behoofe of such as haue an earnest desire to profit and increase al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies more &amp; more in all kind of vertue.</p>

               <p>The reason hereof is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.40</note> because (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> saieth) the summe of all Christian religion consisteth in Charitie: that is to say,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.33 <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8.</note> in the loue of God, and of our neighbour, against which precept there is nothing directlie repugnant, but only deadly sin. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that cōmitteth not this sin, doth es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sētially fulfil, &amp; obserue the law of charity.</p>
               <p>Againe, it appeareth also vnto vs by the
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:9371:303"/> answere,<note place="margin">Deadly sin is directly repugnant to Charity. Mat. <hi>19.17.</hi> Si vis ad vitam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi serua mandata.</note> which our Sauiour gaue vnto the young man, that the way &amp; meane to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine life euerlasting, is the keeping of the Commaundementes. And it is manifest, that euery one keepeth them, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not any deadly sinne: forsomuch as this sinne is nothing els, but a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and breaking of the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Whereof it may be inferred, that in this onely pointe consisteth (as wee sayed) essentially the fulfilling of the lawe of God, and the saluation of man: that is, to be most firmely, and stedfastly bent, &amp; determined, neuer to commit any deadly sin:<note place="margin">How deadly sins are com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted.</note> the which is committed by breaking any one of the ten Commaundementes of God, or of those which the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth representing his place, the which Commandements of the Church are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly numbred to be fiue.</p>
               <p>And this I say, to the end that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian reader may vnderstand, that those seauen, which are commonly called dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sins,<note place="margin">A Rule to discerne a deadly sin.</note> be not alwaies deadly sins, but whē it so falleth out, that they transgresse some one of the Commandements before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. As when the glottony is such, that therby he breaketh any fasting-day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Church, the vvhich he
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:9371:303"/> is bound to obserue: or the slouth so great, that by reason thereof hee omitteth to heare Masse, vpon Sondayes, and Holie dayes, according to his bounden dutie: or the anger so great, as that therby he come to speake any iniurious, slaunderous, or contemptuous wordes against his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and so foorth in all the rest.</p>
               <p>This is now the summe of all that whch a Christian man is bound to doe, (being comprehended in few wordes,) and this sufficeth for his saluation.</p>
               <p>But because to performe his duty fully in this behalfe, is a matter wherein there be great difficulties, by reason of the great snares and perrils, which be in the world, and by reason of the naughty inclination of our flesh, &amp; the continuall cōbats of our enimie the diuel, therefore a man ought to procure many other vertues and exercises also, which to this end may help him very much, in the which consisteth the keye of all this businesse. And of these wee intend now to treate here, &amp; to note brieflly such thinges as may serue vs for this purpose.</p>

                  <p>THE third thing, that helpeth also for this purpose,<note place="margin">Resistance of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before they take strength in the heart.</note> is to resist in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of temptation vvith very great speed &amp; diligence, &amp; to quench the spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the euill thought out of hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be kindled in the heart. For after this sort a man resisteth with great facility and merite. But in case he make any delay therein, then is the labour in resistance ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much increased, &amp; he commiteth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a new sinne, which is at the least a veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sinne, yea, and sometimes a deadly sin. Let him remember, that the flame of fire is easily quenched at the beginning, &amp; that the grasse newly plāted is easie to be pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp by the rootes: But after that the flame is increased, &amp; when the graffe hath once taken root, than will it be very hard to quench the one, and to plucke vp the other. A Cittie may very well be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, before the enimies haue made their entry into it: but after that they haue once entred in, &amp; are in possession thereof, then it is very hard to driue thē out of the same. And as a Philosopher sayeth, when a great stone lyeth vpon the top of a mountaine, it is very easie to stay it there from falling.

                  <p>Now the manner and way for the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of euill thoughts,<note place="margin">The maner how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell euill thoughts.</note> is to set foorthwith before the eyes of thy soule the figure of our Sauiour Christ Crucified, with all the anguishes, and painefull passion which hee suffered vpon the Crosse, sprinckling all the parts of his body with streames of his most pretious blood, and abiding so many strokes and woundes, as there were giuen him.

And the same Doctor, that wrote this, saieth moreouer, that he him selfe had seene this wonderfull thing with his owne eies, and that he had trauailed more than fourtie miles onley to see it.

Who is able to bring to passe, that this day might beginne again with me, which now I haue thus consumed in vaine trifles, and idle, and hurtfull thoughts. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this sort, O my brethren, let vs repent, accuse, and condemne our selues before Almighty God, in the secret places of our houses, &amp; of our harts.</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto are the wordes of <hi>Eusebius Emissenus.</hi>

Forsomuch as the flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fountaine &amp; prouoker of inordinate passions, and appetites, the more feeble, and weake it is, the more feeble, and weak shall the passions also be, which shall proceede of it. For like as the drie, and barren ground bringeth foorth plants, that be likewise weake and barren, and of small substance, but contrarywise.
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:9371:312"/> the battefull, and fertile ground (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, which is well watered, and doun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,) bringeth foorth trees, that be very great, greene, and mighty: euen so the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and appetites, which doe proceed from weake bodies, that be weakned and mortified through Abstinence, are of litle force and strength, and therefore be more easie to be subdewed: and contrariwise those passions, and appetites, which do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from fatt and delicate bodies, such as are continually glutted with aboundance of meates, and drinkes, are much mightier and harder to subdue. Wherefore he that mindeth to weakē &amp; subdue these naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affections, must take great pains to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the causes from whence they proceed.</p>
                  <p>It is also manifest,<note place="margin">Our flesh is a great eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vnto vertue.</note> that the greatest eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, &amp; resister, that vertue hath, is this our flesh, the which with the force of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, &amp; with a desire she hath to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately cherished, &amp; much made of, doth hinder vs from all good exercises, as vvell of praier, reading, silence, close recollectiō of the minde, fasting, watching, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: wherefore, in case we do accustome our selues to yeeld, &amp; giue place vnto our appetites, vndoubtedly the passage vnto al good exercise wil be stopped vp against

Forsomuch as that mā, which is contented with a little, hath no cause to desire much. And this vertue of abstinence doth not only deliuer vs from other euils, but also from all <hi>the cares, phantasies, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp; disquietnes, which are incident of necessity vnto al such, as liue delicately, &amp;
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:9371:313"/> doe make much of themselues. And so by abstinence a man remaineth free and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to giue himselfe wholly to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of GOD. And for this cause were those <hi>Holy Fathers of Egipt</hi> so much giuen to this vertue: with whom agreed very wel the spirit of the holy father <hi>S. Francis,</hi> who commended very much the pouerty both of body and spirit: for all tendeth in the end to one conclusion, both the austeritie of the one, and the pouerty of the other.</p>
                  <p>Now for this cause the true louer of God ought neuer to cease, nor giue rest vnto his eyes, vntill such time, as hee hath attained vnto this degree of vertue: that hee doe handle his body, eyther as a great enimie, and tyrant, (for so it is indeed,) or els as a slaue, a theefe, and as one of euill proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which must be fed (according to the Prouerbe) with bread &amp; stripes: or at the least, as a Sonne brought vp vnder a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and discreet Father, not with anie manner of wantonnes, and delicacy, but with all rigour, &amp; seuerity: to whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neuer sheweth any cherefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but rather enforceth his naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection herein, for the benefit &amp; commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of his child. Now after this sort ought the seruant of God to deale with his body:
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:9371:314"/> and vntill he thus doe, let him not thinke, that he hath greatly profited in the way of vertue. Happie is he, that hath atteined hereunto, that treateth his body after this sort, that keepeth it thus weakned, weried, and tamed, not giuing it his fill of sleepe, &amp; sustenance that constraineth it by force to be obedient vnto the spirit, and that hath with this manner of discipline con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered euen nature her selfe. For he that doth thus, liueth not now according vnto flesh, and bloud, but according vnto the spirit of Christ: neither fighteth he now vnder the laws, and seruices of nature cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, forsomuch as he is become Lord ouer the same: neither yet may he be wel tearmed a mere man, forsomuch as by this meane he is become more thā a man. And this being so, thou maiest therby perceaue the destructiō &amp; ruine of the world at this day, which is bent to none other thing, but to procure by all meanes possible all kinds of pleasures, and delights, &amp; to cherish and pamper vp the bodie with all manner of wantonnes, and delicacie: which is a thing directlye repugnant vnto the spirit of Christ, and to the perfection of a Christian life.</p>

<pb n="648" facs="tcp:9371:315"/> we are most affectionated. For they know that (as the Poet saieth) euery one carieth with him his affection, and delight:<note place="margin">Trahit sua quemque voluptas.</note> &amp; that they may best entrappe vs there, where our hartes are most fixed. I know right wel that men haue reason to gouerne them selues withall:<note place="margin">The affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons are the feete of the soule.</note> but yet (to speake general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) all doe for the most part followe their affections: which are therefore called the feete of the soule: because they carry her whether soeuer they list.

                     <note place="margin">Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</note> saieth, that loue is the poyse of the soule, and that whether soeuer this poyse draweth, thither draweth the soule also.

To conclud, looke as the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and counterpoises be in the clocke, so are the affections in our hart: the which as they be of greater or lesser force, so doe they moue our hart more, or lesse. And therefore in like manner as he that will set a clocke in order, and frame, must haue his counterpoises in such iust proportion, that they neither be too heauie, nor yet too light, but according as the space betwene hower, and hower requireth: euen so he that will lead his life rightly ordered, and

But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, if a man be affectionated with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch loue vnto any thing of the world, forthwith the deuel setteth for him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand snares. For if the thing, which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth so exceedingly be either promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lands, goods, offices, or such like: the deuil representeth vnto his mind a thousād waies, &amp; meanes, whereby he may attaine to that thing, which he loueth. Yea, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when he hath obteined it, then the deuill sheweth him also as many moe waies, and deuises, whereby he may aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and increase the same: of the which meanes, and waies, some shalbe lawfull,<note place="margin">Tbe effectes of Ambitiō.</note> &amp; some vnlawfull. But the force and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of his loue shall so blind him with the very passion thereof, that it will cause him to account them all as lawfull, and to procure them all through the furie of his passion. And if peraduenture in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of these meanes there doe chaūce (as it doth commonly) some impediments competitors, or sutors, which doe pretēd them selues to sue for the same thing, that he is about to obteine, or doe withstand him in his sute, thē there ensueth foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, anger, enuie, rācour, disdaine, malice,

What thing can more liuely resemble the state of those, that are damned in the deep pit of hel? Now in such plight is the soul of an idle person, that hath his gate euermore wide open to receaue all naughtines, and shut vp against all goodnes: forsomuch as nature would not, that any thing that is good, should be obteined without taking of pains, whereof the idle person is a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enimie.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ordinarily the Sacraments doe giue
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:9371:325"/> grace, Praier demaundeth it, and Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes doe merite it: Howbeit it is not Almesdeedes only, that doe merite it, but manie other workes with all, although we doe attribute it particularly to Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes, because it is a rewarde, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth vnto the mercie, which we haue shewed vnto our poore Neighbours, whereby we doe also finde mercie in the sight of Almighrie God. And thus doe Almesdeedes serue, not only to make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for sins past, but also to helpe, that wee doe not commit other new sins. And therefore <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saieth,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Of euery one of these three things there is much to be sayed: but because we haue

And to mortifie this euill loue, hee ought to require instantly this holie hatred, and to procure that his workes, &amp; seuere disciplining of himselfe may speake

And all the doctrine of the philosophers doth verie much commend, that a man should be prepared, and in a readines before hand, to the end, that no daungers may assault him, and find him vnprouided.<note place="margin">Wee must prepare our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations.</note> For this cause it shall doe well in the end of this rule, to note briefly certaine kindes of assaults, and temptations, which are wont to trouble such persons, as doe begin to serue God: that they may at the least vnderstand, that they be temptations in deed. For the verie knowledge thereof is a great helpe towardes the conquering of them. For like as the Fouler, when he laieth his snare, prouideth alwaies, that it may not appeare to be a snare, but meate: euen so the DIVELL when hee tempteh
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:9371:327"/> vs, laboureth so much as is possible, that his temptation may not appeare to be a temptation, but a reasonable motion: For which cause I sayed, that a great part of the victorie ouer a temptation consisteth in knowing, that it is a temptation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, whosoeuer he be, that will enter into this new warfare, let him first of all presuppose, that hee must abide great assaults, and many temptations of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: whereof wee are admonished by the wise man not without great cause. O my sonne saith hee, when thou purposest to serue God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.1.</note> see that thou liue with feare, &amp; prepare thy soule vnto temptations.</p>
               <p>Among these temptations the first is, when we are tempted <hi>in matters of Faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Temptation in matters of Faith.</note> for whereas, a man before the time of his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, was as it were in a sleepe, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the consideration of matters of the Catholicke Faith, now when he newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to open his eyes, &amp; to see the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries thereof, he beginneth forthwith (as a stranger in a forraine country) to wauer in such thinges, as are opened vnto him. And this is, by reason of the little light, &amp; small vnderstanding, which hee hath of them. And so it fareth with him, as with a new prentice, that entreth into a rich ware
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:9371:327"/> house, or shop of some notable Artificer, where hee findeth many sortes of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and tooles, and not vnderstanding to what vse they are made, he gaseth, and wondereth forthwith at euery thing that he seeth, and beginneth to aske questions: wherefore is this? And why is that? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that afterwardes perceauing by vse, to what purpose ech thing doth serue, hee quieteth his minde and is perswaded that such thinges be very necessary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, as seemed to him before verie straunge.</p>
               <p>There is an other temptation, which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of <hi>Blasphemie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Temptation of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> This temptation represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the minde of a man, when hee is set to meditate vpon heauenly thinges, the shapes of certaine thinges that be filthie &amp; abhominable. For when a man doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his imagination from the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet full of the shapes and figures of worldly thinges, he cannot sodainely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch away from his minde the shape of such thinges, as hath bin by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance imprinted therein: and therefore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with spirituall formes and figures, there are also represented vnto him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly certaine carnall, and filthie shapes, which doe torment him very much that is
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:9371:328"/> troubled with them. The best waie that may be taken to ouercome these tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is to make no accoūt of them: forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they be in deed rather a kinde of frighting, and fearing of our enimie, than anie true daunger in deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> An other temptation there is of <hi>Scruples.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> An other temptation there is, which is, <hi>to be quickly scandalised and offended at euerie thing,</hi>

For when they begin to open their eyes, and to vnderstand what a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thing it is to serue Almighty God, so soone as they come newly to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, they wonder greatly at thē that doe the contrary, and are therewith much troubled, &amp; doe disdaine thē.

               <p>Such men doe not consider, that by chaunging of places the ayer is chaunged, and not the mind, and that to what place soeuer a man goeth, he carrieth him selfe with him: that is to saie, a minde rent and torne with sinne, (being as it is, a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all store house of miseries, and troubles:) and that this is not remedied with chaūg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="679" facs="tcp:9371:331"/> is to forsake the way, that they haue begun, &amp; to returne againe to the world: for the compassing whereof the deuell v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a thousand deuises. Sometimes with strong temptations of the flesh, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto thē the state of mariage, as a sure hauen, and quiet life: which is (to speake the truth) a whirlepoole of continual trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and torments: alledging for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the examples of manie Patriarkes, which being maried were Saincts: &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them in hand, that they shall finde for that state of life a meete companion, that shalbe of the same intention &amp; mind as they be of, and that they shall bring vp their children in the feare of God. And here will he represent vnto them, what almes they may giue in that state, which they cannot doe abiding in Religion: telling them moreouer that this giuing of almes is a great meane to be assured of the Kingdome of Heauen at the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The desire to enter into a more strait re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is some times a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</note>Sometimes, contrary hereunto, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell will goe about to deceaue them with higher imaginations, preferring vnto them other orders of Religion, which be more strait than that, wherein they are entered: &amp; especially the <hi>Holie Order of the Carthusians</hi>
                  <pb n="680" facs="tcp:9371:331"/> The which thing he doth, to allure them out of their Religion with this pretence, that after he hath once entised them out of their religion, he may then take full po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssession of them, and carrie them vpon his hornes whither he listeth.</p>
               <p>Some times also the diuell bringeth them to be in loue excedingly with solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie life, vsing thereunto the examples, &amp; liues of the <hi>Auncient Holie Heremites:</hi> to the end that when he hath led them from al company through this solitary walke, hauing them there alone, where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take aduise or counsaile of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall FATHERS, and CONFESSOVRS, hee may the more easily preuaile against them.</p>
               <p>But among all these kindes of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the most daungerous are those,<note place="margin">Temptatiōs couered with the cloke of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are most daungerous.</note> that come vnder pretence of goodnes, and doe beare a shew of vertue. For such thinges, as be openly naught, doe carrie with them their owne filthines, and superscription, whereby they are knowen, and abhorred: but those thinges, that haue an outward shewe of goodnes, are more perilous: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause with this colour, and shew of vertue they may the more easily beguile vs. By which kinde of way our common aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:9371:332"/> the deuell preuaileth more, than by any other, in tempting the seruants of God: for whereas he knoweth right well, that they be already determined to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the euill, and to embrace the good: he procureth (if hee may) to giue them to drinke the poyson of sinne mingled vvith this deceitfull honie.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.5.</note> In which point hee may well be resembled to those great eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which being desirous to bring him out of the fauour of king <hi>Darius,</hi> and so to put him to death, and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many meanes in vaine to bring this to passe, in fine they resolued, that they could entrappe him by no deuise, vnlesse it were by meane of transgressing some Commā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement or statute of the law. And so they did, albeit that this also serued not their turne, because almighty God prouided for his seruant. After this sort doth the Diuell tempt good men ordinarily, and by this way doth he lay snares to catch them, and therefore it is necessary that wee be well aduised, what affection wee beare euen to such thinges,<note place="margin">Excessiue affection &amp; loue of good things is to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</note> as seeme to vs to be good: For although there be no fault in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a thing, yet is there in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue affection thereof. Wherefore, vve ought to suspect euery excessiue, &amp; vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:9371:332"/> affection: forsomuch as the excesse in euery thing is alwaies to be feared.</p>
               <p>These be the most common temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of such as begin to serue God.<note place="margin">Remedies against tēp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy whereof is humilitie, submission, praier, confession, and the wisedome of a good Ghostly Father, which is as a good Pylot, whose care must be to guide this shippe with great discreation through the middest of the waues of the tempestious, &amp; stormy Sea of this world, where the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious windes of the malignant spirites doe bluster and blow, &amp; stir vp great tempests and stormes. But aboue all this, Almighty God is our chiefest remedie, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our weakenes, and helpeth vs with his grace, &amp; deuideth vs from the land of the Philistians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.17.</note> that they may not vex vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch with their cruell assaultes at our departing out of Egypt: and who suffereth vs not (as the Apostle saieth) to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond our power:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</note> but rather increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his grace in vs, when hee seeth vs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the battaile. To conclude, the remedies of all these temptations are the very same, which we haue before declared to be remedies against sin.

                  <p>For the obteining of this diuine vertue of Charity,<note place="margin">How Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie may be obteined.</note> among many other thinges, are required chiefly three. The first is, to purge the soule of all inordinate appetites &amp; passions, and of all sins,<note place="margin">To purge the soule.</note> that do proceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of them: for the <hi>diuine wisdome</hi> (as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) <hi>will not enter into an euill conscience, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it make her abode in a heart subiect vnto sins.</hi> Wherefore,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sap.</hi> 1.4.</note> such as desire to loue almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, let thē endeuor to sequester them selues from all sinnes: and not onely from all deadly sinnes: but also (so much as in them lieth) euen frō venial sins. For in like manner as a glasse, the brighter it is, the more clearely it receiueth the sun beams: euen so the purer a soule is, the more it doth participate of the clearenesse, and bright beames of the loue of God.</p>
                  <p>The second thing that is requisite for thee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Charity, is for a man closlie to recollect himselfe<note place="margin">For a man closlly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> within himselfe, as often as hee may, &amp; to call to minde all such thinges, as may moue his hart to loue almighty God. The which if he doe, hee shal find that all those causes of loue, that be found in all creatures, are to be found altogether in God alone, yea, &amp; all in the highest degree of perfectiō.</p>
                  <pb n="695" facs="tcp:9371:339"/>
                  <p>And because the Philosophers affirme, that goodnes is naturally to be beloued,<note place="margin">
                        <p>The thinges that doe spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially mooue vs to loue God.</p>

                     </note> &amp; that euery one loueth his owne proper weale, hereof it commeth, that two things doe chieflie prouoke vs to this diuine loue: to wit, <hi>the greatnes of the perfections of God, and the greatnes of his benefits.</hi> Of the which two pointes wee shall treate hereafter in their proper place. And herewith it is good also, to consider the great loue that Almighty God beareth towardes vs, and what great cause we haue to loue him also, in that he is our Father, our Brother, our King, our Lord, our God, and our last end, (in regard wherof he is called the spouse of our soules) and therefore deserueth to be loued with infinite loue: forsomuch as such loue is due to the last end. Now the consideration of these thinges, the longer and profounder it is, the greater loue shall it cause vs to haue vnto almighty God, whome wee doe in such meditations set before our eyes. And for this cause, he that mindeth to take great profit in the loue of God, must spend a great time in this consideration.</p>
                  <p>An other meane there is besides this for the obtaining of Charity, which is a short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more compendious meane: that is, when the soule being wounded and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:9371:339"/> with the sweet delight of this lord, and inamoured with his so great excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, demaundeth most instantly and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually of him, who only can giue this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Charitie, that hee will vouchsafe to graunt the same vnto her: seeming vnto her, that it is a shorter, and more speedie way for the obtaining of the loue of God, to demaund it of him, than to straine it out by little and little, and as it were droppe, by droppe, by force of considerations. For which cause such a one accounteth it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pray than to meditate. And so hee praieth, and maketh petition continuallie with most feruent and burning desires, for this so precious a iewell: for the which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is needfull, that he haue alwaies in a readines some sweet, and louing praiers, wherewith his Religious soule may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto Almighty God this his desire. Of the which praiers, and of all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth vnto this vertue of Charity shalbe treated hereafter in his proper <hi>Treatise of the loue of God.</hi> And be thou well assured, that not one of these praiers, and sighes, shalbe frustrate, and spent in vaine: For sith our Lord is alwaies so liberall, and bountifull in his giftes, hee will graunt thee for thy praiers, eyther new deuotion, or new light,
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:9371:340"/> or els he will giue thee increase of grace, or drawe thy heart more effectually vnto him, or comfort and recreate thee vvith greater fweetnes, &amp; delite, or els hee vvill giue thee greater force to perseuere &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish thy good beginning: wherefore leese not (my good brother) through a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle negligence these inestimable benefits, which thou mayest obtaine euery momēt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Purity of intention.</note>Vnto this same Charity it doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine also to purifie the eye of our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all our workes, pretending therein, not our owne commoditie, and interest, neither yet our owne honour and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: but the well pleasing, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō of Almighty God. In such sort, that whatsoeuer wee shall doe, (eyther follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our owne will, or the will of others) it be done, nor for manners sake, nor for a bare Ceremony, nor for necessity, nor by constraint, nor to please the eyes of men, nor yet for any other interest or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the world, but purely for the loue of God: as an honest woman serueth her husband, not in respect of any dowry, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, or other commodity that she hopeth for of him, but for the loue shee beareth vnto him: wherin it is meet, that the soule should be so faithfull and chaste, that like
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:9371:340"/> as the honest wife trimmeth, and decketh herselfe only to please the eyes of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and not of any other man: euen so must the soule procure the ornament, and garnishing of vertues, onely to please the eyes of Almightie God. Howbeit, I speak not this, as to condemne the dooing of good workes,<note place="margin">

For (as <hi>Saint Bernard</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                     </note> saieth) perfect loue increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not in strength through hope, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it dismaied through mistrust: forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it laboureth not in hope of anie thing that shalbe giuen, neyther doth it cease to labour, although there be no hope of any gift: because it was not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, or interest, that mooued it to take paines, but only loue.</p>
                  <p>And this pure intention ought a man to haue, not only in the beginning, or end of his workes, but also at the very time, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest he is in dooing them, he ought to doe
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:9371:341"/> them in such wise, that he be offering thē there vnto almighty God, &amp; that in doing them, he be then also actually exercising himselfe in louing of God: so that whilest he is in working, he may seeme no lesse both to loue, and pray, than to work. And after this manner he shal not be distracted in the workes, which he shal doe. For in this wise did the Sainctes worke, and yet not-withstanding were not distracted, when they did worke. So is it spoken of the spouse in the canticles by a figure,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11.</note> that her garments sauoured of incense. Fot by the garments of the soule we vnderstand the vertues,<note place="margin">Vertuous workes be the garmēts of the soule.</note> wherewith she is adorned: &amp; by the incense, which being cast into the fire ascendeth vp on high, and yeeldeth a sweet sauour, we vnderstand praier, which being done here on earth, worketh in Heauen. Now then to say, that the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the spouse sauoured of incense, is to say, that she wrought the works of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in such sort, that her working apeared as wel to be praying, as working, by reason of the great deuotiō wherwith she did her workes. We see the mother when she is occupied in washing the feet of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or husband, which are come home from farre countries, that she doth both
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:9371:341"/> loue them, and serue them together, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting herselfe, and taking great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, &amp; contentation in that seruice which shee doth vnto them. Euen so ought our minde to be affected, when it purposeth to doe any seruice vnto her Creator, and in so doing shall her garments sauour of this spirituall incense.</p>
                  <p>What worke so euer is thus done, is of great merite:<note place="margin">The merite of a good worke depē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the purity of the intention.

                     </note> Forsomuch as the merite of our workes doth chiefly depende of the purity of our intention, and of the loue, &amp; deuotion, wherewith they are done: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may well be compared vnto money: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or in money we make not so great accoūt of the number, as of the mettall. Because a little gold is much more worth, thā a great quantity of copper. Euen so in good works the multitude of them is not so much to be regarded, as the loue and deuotion, with the which they be done. As it appeareth by the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te offered by the poore widow spoken of in the Gospell: which was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter esteemed, than the great offeringes of many rich men. And so it happeneth that a good worke may be done vvith such a will, charity, and deuotion, that it shall be more valewed in the sight of Almightie God, than many others, that are not done
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:9371:342"/> after the like manner. So that like as a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent praier obteineth more of God, than manie others, which are neither hote nor colde: euen so doth a worke done with great feruour, and deuotion merit more, than manie others, which are not so done. The which point ought diligentlie to be marked of those persons, whose states of life doe binde them continuallie to doe good workes, that they take good heede after what sort they be done: &amp; that they presume not in the multitude of theyr workes, but to be carefull to doe them with great loue, and deuotion.</p>

<pb n="702" facs="tcp:9371:342"/> Charity is one only habite, but that it hath these two acts, the one to loue God, &amp; the other to loue our neighbor for Gods sake. This is the final cause, for which we ought to loue our neighbours. This is also the greatest motiue, why we should loue thē, be they neuer so vnworthy of our loue: for we ought to respect them, &amp; to loue them not so much for theyr own sakes, as for the loue of that Lord, who hath created them, and redeemed them, &amp; hath commanded vs to loue thē for his sake: for admit that there be no cause in them,<note place="margin">For what cause woe should loue our ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The which duties are those three partes of iustice, wherein the Prophet <hi>Micheas</hi>

                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>§. 1.</head>
                     <p>TO beginne then with the greatest of these bounden duties, it is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be noted, that, like as among precious stones, there are some, which euen of their owne nature, and kinde, are more excellent than others, as the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, diamondes, emeralds, and such other: euen so, among vertues, there are some,
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:9371:360"/> which of their own nature and kinde doe incomparably excede all others. And these be such vertues, as haue their eye and regard vnto God, and be therefore called <hi>Theologicall vertues:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Theological vertues</note> vnto the which we maie also adioyne the feare, and reuerence of God: and withall Religion: whose office consisteth in the honouring of GOD, with all that belongeth vnto the seruice, &amp; worshippe of God. These are the most principall among al vertues: and not onlie the most principall, but also the stirrers, &amp; prouokers of them. For which cause they be compared with the other vertues, as the heauens with all the other inferiour creatures, which doe depend of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Wherefore he that desireth to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vnto the perfection of a Christiā life, although he be bound to trauaile vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally in all vertues, (for like as it is meete, that al the stringes of a lute be first accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and tuned, before it be plaied vppon: euen so is it likewise requisit to haue al the vertues for the better ordering, and fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a good life) yet ought he especially to labor to increase, &amp; profit in these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saied vertues. For the more he shall profit in them, the greater shall his perfection be. And for this cause I beleeue, that many of
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:9371:361"/> those holy Patriarkes were so notable in vertue, as <hi>Dauid, Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; such like: forsomuch as, although they were maried and rich men, and had great affaires, and dutifull cares, for theyr pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions to attend vnto, yet all that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were most holy men, because they had these most excellent vertues: as it appeared in the Faith, and Obedience of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the loue, submission, deuotion, and confidence, which <hi>Dauid</hi> had in almighty God, in that he had such recourse vnto him in all hys necessities, and did put such trust in him, as a childe doth in his father, yea, &amp; much more,<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Now to obtaine these so noble ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, there is none other meane more conuenient for our purpose, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues, and to fixe in our minds with all the hope, that is possible, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is our true father, and more than a father: forsomuch as neyther in the hart of a father, nor in the prouidence of a father, neyther yet in the loue of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is any comparable vnto him: for none hath created vs, but he: none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth more our profit than hee. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:9371:361"/> once settled in our harts, let vs endeuour alwaies to behold him with such eyes, and with such a hart, as a childe doth his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that is, with a louing hart, with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hart, with an humble &amp; reuerent hart, with a hart subiect, and obedient to hys holy will, &amp; with a hart full of confidence in all troubles and aduersities, and couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnder the winges of his fatherly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>With such eyes and hart ought a man to behold Almighty God, as oftentimes, as he shall call him to minde. The which he ought to doe, as often in the day, and night as he may: to the end, that so he may proceede forward by little and little vvith the help and fauour of God, in procuring, and nourishing this manner of hart in hys soule: according as that holy Prophet did, who sayed. Thy name O Lord, and the remembrance thereof,<note place="margin">

                     <p>This kind of affection and hart towards Almighty God cannot be expressed with wordes, nor obtained with our forces one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore he only knoweth it, that

Fourthly, hee ought to haue a gentle benigne behauiour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability towards all men, vsing himselfe in conuersation among them with all curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, mildenesse, and gentlenesse, &amp; wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all vvell, and making demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration thereof after this sort in all hys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> wordes, and deedes. Fiftly, hee ought to haue an humble reuerence towardes all men, accounting them for hys betters, &amp; submitting himselfe vvith all hys hart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men, as if they were hys very Lords <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and Maisters. Sixtly, he must haue a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect agreement, and concorde vvith all men, to the end, that (so much as in him lieth, and so farre foorth, as it shall please
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:9371:364"/> God to graunt him,) hee may say one selfe same thing, and agree in opinion with all men, and be perswaded, that all men are euen himselfe, and that hee is all men, and so account the contentation, &amp; desire of all others for his own. Seauenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> following the example of our Sauiour Christ, hee ought to haue a ready minde to offer himselfe for all men: that is, hee ought to be prepared to bestow his life for the saluation of all men, and to praie both day and night vnto Almighty God for them, and to endeuour, that they all may be one in Christ, and Christ in them. Howbeit, let him not therefore thinke, that vve binde him here not to auoide the company of naughty persons:<note place="margin">When com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is to be auoyded.</note> but rather let him vnderstand, that when there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such, whose company might be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vnto him of sinne, or any hinderance of his spirituall exercises, or diminishing of the feruour of Charity, he ought to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate himselfe from all such companie, as from Serpentes: for there is no cole so glowing hoate, but that being cast into the vvater vvill be quenched: neyther yet so quenched, but that being cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine among many other burning coales it may be set on fire: but setting this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:9371:365"/> aside, the seruant of God ought to be simple in his conuersation with hys neighbours, and eyther to winke at theyr defects, or els, if he must needes see them, then to beare them with patience, or to admonish them charitably, when there is hope of redresse thereby.</p>

                  <p>FORSOMVCH, as there be certaine persons, that desire to haue alwaies before theyr eyes the principall points of the Spirituall life: therefore I intende briefly to abridge in these two last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the principall thinges, which the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God ought to doe: and those also which he ought especially to eschue &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide: to the end, that in this briefe Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary hee may see, as it wete in a glasse, what he is bound to doo.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching the first part: to wit, what hee ought to doe: the first point is, that he endeuour himselfe to goe alwaies in the presence of God. And if he cannot doe this continually, yet let him at the least lift vp his heart vnto him oftentimes both by day, and by night, with briefe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and humble praiers and aspirations, desiring him alwaies of his help, and loue;
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:9371:368"/> as one, that is able to doe nothing without him.</p>

                        <hi>2.</hi> That all thinges in this world may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations vnto him to loue God.</note>The Second is, that whatsoeuer he shall heare, see, or read, hee endeuour him selfe alwaies, as the bees doe among the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to sucke out of euery thing some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to carrie vnto his hiue: to wit, some deuout and louing consideration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he may engender, and nourish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him the sweete hony combe of the loue of God, in such sort, that as a great fire conuerteth al thinges into fire, that are cast therein, (whether it be water, iron, or whatsoeuer it bee,) euen so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his hart ought to be so inflamed in the fire of the loue of God, that all thinges, that are in this world, of what quality soeuer they be, maie be matter and prouocations vnto him, to loue God.</p>
                  <p>The Third is, when he shall at anie time commit any defects, or shall fall into any distractions of mind,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Distraction of mind.</note> let him not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be dismaied, nor giue ouer his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall exercises: but let him returne vnto Almightie God with an humble, and louing conuersion, acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owne great miserie, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the mercie of Almightie God. And let him doe what lieth in him, to
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:9371:368"/> returne vnto his former state, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede foreward with that he hath begun.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth is, that he labour to haue a pure intention in al thinges,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>4.</hi> Purity of intention.</note> whatsoeuer he shal doe. For the which it is meet, that he doe aduisedlie ballance and examine all his wordes, workes, and thoughtes, and consider what intention hee hath in the same, and let him endeuour alwaies to rectifie and directe it: offering all that he shall thus doe vnto the glorie of Almightie God, not only once in the day but at all times, so often as he shall newlie beginne to take any worke in hand.</p>
                  <p>The Fifte is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>5.</hi> To arme himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all occasions of Anger.</note> that hee endeuour to goe armed, and prepared, (yea, though it be in time of peace,) to receiue with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, mildenes, and patience, all thinges that may of a sodaine be stirred &amp; moued against him. For although anger doe serue somtimes to some purpose, yet surely it is a wonder, if it come to any good end: and it leaueth the conscience alwaies scrupulous and fearefull,<note place="margin">Anger lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the conscience scrupulous and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> whether it hath exceeded, or not. &amp;c.

And he that shall conquer this Passion, shall vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:9371:369"/> liue in great peace, and tranquility.</p>
                  <p>The sixt is if he be not a Bishop, Pastor Prelate, or Maister of a household, that he doe alwaies turne awaie his eies from beholding other mens defectes.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>6.</hi> We must looke to our own defects and not to other mens.</note> But let him continually fixe them vpon his owne defects.

But the second bringeth with it confusion of his own conscience, the feare of God, humility, and a close recollection of his mind.</p>
                  <p>The Seuenth is, that he doe sequester himselfe, not only with his soule, but euen with his body also, from all transitory thinges:<note place="margin">

                  <p>The eight is, that he fasten his eyes alwaies vpon the life of our Sauiour Christ and vpon his most sacred Passion, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and doctrine: and endeuour (so much as he may possibly) to imitate, and followe those so notable examples of his vertues:<note place="margin">

                  <p>MANIE defects there are, vvhich doe hinder the profitting in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, and whereby many at the ende of many yeares are the very selfe-same persons, that they were alwaies before. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which defects wee will note at this present twelue of the most principall: in the which a man ought to looke, as it were in a glasse, that he may the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his owne defects, and learne vvhat the cause is that hindereth hys going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in spirituall life, and so according to the cause prouide remedy for the same.</p>
                  <p>The first of these defects is, when a man is ouermuch giuen vnto his outwarde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and busines,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The second is,<note place="margin">
                        <p n="2">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Ouermuch affabilitie and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

And thus doth hee loose his time, and faileth oftentimes in his exercises, for that he will not faile the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men: whereby it commeth to passe, that the more hee studieth to please men, the lesse he pleaseth God.</p>

                  <p>The sixt is, when he is readie and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to iudge others, and to aggrauate,<note place="margin">
